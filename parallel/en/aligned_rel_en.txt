and Jokmeam with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs
and Aijalon with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs
and Ramoth with her suburbs, and Anem with her suburbs

and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea
Kedemoth also with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs
and did all eat the same spiritual meat
and Heshbon with her suburbs, and Jazer with her suburbs

But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God

But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven

and Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man
And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath

For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you
And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper
Beriah also, and Shema, who were heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of Gath
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come
and Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal
and Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimhi

and Iphedeiah, and Penuel, the sons of Shashak
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep
and Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham

And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife's name was Maachah
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another
Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims

And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh
And the rest will I set in order when I come
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant
and Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led
and Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit
who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord
And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal
And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit
All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve
to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit
These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office
but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will
So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards
In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south
For the body is not one member, but many
And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing
For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God
If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling
And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him
And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale
And if they were all one member, where were the body
Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices
But now are they many members, yet but one body
And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary
And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans
and those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath
that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another
And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular
These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal
and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing
and Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up
rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away
So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things
And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa
Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy
And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort
And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped
And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle
they arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification
So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me
and enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful
Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither
For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified
Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all
And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad
So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief
But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all
And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth
And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city
How is it then, brethren
So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him
when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation
These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel
Let all things be done unto edifying
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties
But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God
And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance
Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge
If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace
And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Beth-lehem
For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints
Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties
Let all things be done decently and in order
Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles
Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war
And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time
Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed
The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead
and Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite
But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen
and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain
Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites
and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised
Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third
and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth
Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power
Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh
For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet
These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west
And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all
And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David
And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host
For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God
All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds
And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD
it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly
and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye
And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me
Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia
And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go
For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit
But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost
And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them
For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries
Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader
As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time
And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong
And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people
Let all your things be done with charity
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim
I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it
that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth
And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart
The churches of Asia salute you
And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets
Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled
All the brethren greet you
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God
Greet ye one another with an holy kiss
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you
So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full
And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth
Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us
and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet
And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees
But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things
David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations
And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning
If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father
And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it
And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life
And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure
and said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel
He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning
And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another
and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren
and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth
He that loveth not his brother abideth in death
and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him
And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful
And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy
And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment
And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him
And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen
And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God
And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart
They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them
And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love
And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him
And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit
Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world
Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God
Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name,
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us
Make known his deeds among the people
God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him,
Talk ye of all his wondrous works
Glory ye in his holy name:
We love him, because he first loved us
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD
And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also
Seek the LORD and his strength,
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments
Seek his face continually
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth
and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him
O ye seed of Israel his servant,
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not
Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness
He is the LORD our God;
His judgments are in all the earth
to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you
Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
And of his oath unto Isaac
receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls
And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law,
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
And to Israel for an everlasting covenant
but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
When ye were but few,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
Even a few, and strangers in it
All flesh is as grass,
And when they went from nation to nation,
And all the glory of man as the flower of grass
And from one kingdom to another people
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away
He suffered no man to do them wrong:
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes
Declare his glory among the heathen;
His marvellous works among all nations
having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised:
or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well
He also is to be feared above all gods
For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
For all the gods of the people are idols:
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward
But the LORD made the heavens
For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully
Glory and honour are in his presence;
For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently
Strength and gladness are in his place
but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God
Fear before him, all the earth:
For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls
The world also shall be stable, that it be not moved
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof:
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel
Let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous
Let him eschew evil, and do good;
So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required
Let him seek peace, and ensue it
and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters
And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good
and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon
having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel
by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison
and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God
And the sons of Jeduthun were porters
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you
And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel
Use hospitality one to another without grudging
and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God
And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you
He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified
I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away
And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time
casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you
O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever
O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt
so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God
For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain
Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee
as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children
And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us
Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing
And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts
Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming
And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates
For ye are our glory and joy
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men
therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem
for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord
Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass
night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah
Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you
Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand
For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus
And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants
that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour
Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went
not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God
So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people
But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king
And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me
Wherefore comfort one another with these words
And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you
So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field
For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night
Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do
And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon
And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you
And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him
And be at peace among yourselves
And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them
Quench not the Spirit
And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them
Despise not prophesyings
So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him
Prove all things; hold fast that which is good
Abstain from all appearance of evil
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it
Brethren, pray for us
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned
But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him
But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully
And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel
for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David
for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword
But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab
who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth
And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting
And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
For Adam was first formed, then Eve
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression
So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men
one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity
And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground
Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus
And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof
These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon
For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving
But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer
And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David
For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe
Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel
These things command and teach
And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine
but the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight
the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity
Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee
Honour widows that are widows indeed
Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying
having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith
So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel
And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not
And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites
I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand
For some are already turned aside after Satan
moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith
Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari
Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear
And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities
Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed
But godliness with contentment is great gain
And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them
And having food and raiment let us be therewith content
These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward
For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above
because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God
both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size
Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort
and to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ
ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf
and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office
who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts
And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness
Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar
Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many
And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him
Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ
lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices
all these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place
And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters
For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish
So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward
the third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious
the fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory
the fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth
the sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech
the seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart
the eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve

the ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve

the tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed
the eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body
the twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
the thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
So then death worketh in us, but life in you
the fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God
the fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day
the sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory
the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit
the eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
the nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
(for we walk by faith, not by sight:)
the twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord
the one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him
the two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad
the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause
the four and twentieth to Romamti-ezer, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve
and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again
Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new
The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah
We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain
All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obed-edom
And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen
Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)
Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed
And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings
To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed
as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things
Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged
At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels
These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged
And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God
As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli
The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD
Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus
Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites
For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season
and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures
And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son
Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all
Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him
And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things
Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia
And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king
how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality
Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers
praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints
In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead
And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God
And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love
Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich
And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago
Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not
But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches
avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you
of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready
These were the princes of the tribes of Israel
lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting
But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully
and over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub
and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work
All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's
Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons
being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God
and of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God
And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father
and by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift
Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh
Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat
and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled
and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance
also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD
If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's
He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed
And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver
that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters
also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver
For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible
and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present
But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you
Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ
Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance
Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ
Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia
And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite
God knoweth
Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy
But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works
For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting
O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also
O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise
And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God
For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face
And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak
and did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness
Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also
And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest
Are they Hebrews
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him
so am I
And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king
Are they Israelites
And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel
so am I
Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel
Are they the seed of Abraham
And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem
so am I
Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer
Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep
in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches
and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom
Who is weak, and I am not weak
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah
who is offended, and I burn not
but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities
Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure
And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness
But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called
Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me
And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon
and lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed
And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth
And the king bowed himself upon the bed
Greet one another with an holy kiss
And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way
for the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love
Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments
This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace
This is a deceiver and an antichrist
So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David
for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds
grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord
Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge
And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh
Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance
knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar
knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of
For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment
and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again
(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)
the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days
whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in
Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness
And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude
grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer
seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him
And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle
And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it
comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed
So king Solomon was king over all Israel
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means
The Lord be with you all
the son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan
greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy
the son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher
whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles
This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes
Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam
but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me
the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also
Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim
And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits
Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth
Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin
ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables
ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl
Only Luke is with me
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon
Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus
of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge
And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt
And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five
because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David
The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying
and, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire
And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven
beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work
And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilæans
And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house
And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born
And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD
For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights
I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh:
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about
And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building
And your young men shall see visions,
And your old men shall dream dreams
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father
So Solomon built the house, and finished it
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long
Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD
Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles
And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high
And all that believed were together, and had all things common
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits
and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need
who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold
And all the people saw him walking and praising God
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord
and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you
So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall
Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days
And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work
being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams
And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide
and in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it
And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes
So was he seven years in building it
and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel
And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves
And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks
saying, What shall we do to these men
And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits
For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed
And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house
And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word
Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold
And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him
And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits
And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things
And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow
And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them
and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men
And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people
and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law
and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars
And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel
and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases
And he said,
and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea
Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan
And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion
Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls
And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month
Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph
And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live
And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims
And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian
For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD
Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground
so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge
Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word
And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
And there was great joy in that city
And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women
And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father
But will God indeed dwell on the earth
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost
behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God
If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven
then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers
And he said, Who art thou, Lord
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them
And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man
If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem
what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house
But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him
that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
but their laying await was known of Saul
Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake
And they watched the gates day and night to kill him
(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house
Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name
And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda
If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause
If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause
And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter
and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air
And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee
And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying
and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons
that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers
but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him
that word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judæa, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached
that all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else
him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly
And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word

And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword
And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God
and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay
And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat
Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him
And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die
And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad
And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children
And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array
And they set themselves in array against the city
And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter
And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms
And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel
But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left
And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber
Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee
And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him
Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee
And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him
And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria
And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria
And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers
And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread
So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth
They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people
And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying
But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up
And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying
And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel
And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother
And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints
And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him
which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth
So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria
who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit
And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake
For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem
in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins
And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
and he is before all things, and by him all things consist
For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell
And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel
and, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land
whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God
There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king
even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber
whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily
And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross
and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it
but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God
When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory
for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth
in the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds
and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering
And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow
And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him
And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged
and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons
And Hannah prayed, and said,
Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven
My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time
Mine horn is exalted in the LORD:
Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man
My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts
Because I rejoice in thy salvation
For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis
There is none holy as the LORD:
For there is none beside thee:
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it
Neither is there any rock like our God
And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes
Talk no more so exceeding proudly;
Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth:
For the LORD is a God of knowledge,
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
And by him actions are weighed
The bows of the mighty men are broken,
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself
And they that stumbled are girded with strength
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs
They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
And they that were hungry ceased:
So that the barren hath born seven;
So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days
And she that hath many children is waxed feeble
And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich:
Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse
He bringeth low, and lifteth up
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm
To set them among princes,
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus
And to make them inherit the throne of glory:
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him
For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's,
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams
And he hath set the world upon them
So they came and stood before the king
He will keep the feet of his saints,
And the wicked shall be silent in darkness;
For by strength shall no man prevail
And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel
Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD
Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son
Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD
And they went unto their own home
Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel
And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters
And the child Samuel grew before the LORD
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things
for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people
And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain
he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king
Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions
that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon
And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli
And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king
As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image
And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle
This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible
In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass
For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not
his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces
And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD
And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth
And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again
And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay
And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp
And they said, Woe unto us
And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken
for there hath not been such a thing heretofore
Woe unto us
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay
who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods
these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain
Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him
And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king
And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon
And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up
And the man came in hastily, and told Eli
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages
And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up
And he had judged Israel forty years
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews
But she answered not, neither did she regard it
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever
And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband
Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up
When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day
And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months
Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him
They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts
when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed
Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon
and they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me
And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace
And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley
Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream
And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof
Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life
And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places
And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba
And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment
Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee
the leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it
And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven
And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants
And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants
And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD
The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth
whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation
And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not
that they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule
All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying
And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found
And on whom is all the desire of Israel
And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons
Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another
Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance
Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied
Then was Daniel brought in before the king
and the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man
And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry
I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee
And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this
And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place
then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting
And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found
Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom
But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not
In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain
And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken
Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions
Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree
And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house
Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God
But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us
And they despised him, and brought him no presents
But he held his peace
And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly
And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions
And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever
And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand
Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den
So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another
And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time
Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me
When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this
And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them
So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth
And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king
Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them
and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you
If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God
but if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers
Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes
But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end
So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel
and turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain
For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land
And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them
As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man
And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash
and another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness
The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia
but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up
Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans
But he told not his father
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem
And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes
The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah
we have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land
Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them
O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee
O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him
neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets
And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another
And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God
For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel
Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan
yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation
And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding
And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy
So none of the people tasted any food
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times
And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel
then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz
his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude
And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint
And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood
And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands
And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia
And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb
And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines
For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel
But he answered him not that day
Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me
And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day
For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die
But there was not a man among all the people that answered him
And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will
Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place
And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them
And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel
So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley
And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt
So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly
Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying
It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found
And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant
And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people
At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter
And Samuel said,
And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate
Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,
And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits
As in obeying the voice of the LORD
And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
And to hearken than the fat of rams
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed
But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent
Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river
And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul
grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will
to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved
wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory
cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power
which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places
far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins
And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
not of works, lest any man should boast
Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands
but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them
For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God
And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass
in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord
And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders
if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward
how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words
whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid
of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man
But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem
may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height
And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us
unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers
till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ
that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive
But ye have not so learned Christ
if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus
And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind
and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness
Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath
neither give place to the devil
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail
and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you
And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints
And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance
Be not ye therefore partakers with them
And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves
(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
And the Philistine cursed David by his gods
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret
redeeming the time, because the days are evil
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is
And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord
giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God
And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord
And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing
And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it
that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church
And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul
for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones
And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right
Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul
And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord
with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men
knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it
above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
And David avoided out of his presence twice
And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul
and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel
And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him
whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God
In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity
the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him
But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife
And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings
And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass
And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David
As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle
And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies
And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went
But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning
And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning
And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him
Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces
And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually
When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went
As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four
Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above
And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies
And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it
And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about
And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth
As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD
And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake
And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day
And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious
And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein
and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe
And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise
So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll
And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also
And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee
Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness
And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them
For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel
Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing
Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days
And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him
Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul
Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty
Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house
And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel
But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them
and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house
But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away
Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem
and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about
Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it
And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem
This shall be a sign to the house of Israel
For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel
Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it
And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege
And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him
And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it
And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot
Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink
And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him
And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts
And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her
But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations
And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city
And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations
A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them
Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by
When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread
So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away
And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath
And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath
And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard
And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men
And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold
Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain
And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests
And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod
And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David
And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house
And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side
And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity
And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand
Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne
And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men
And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city
And he went in in my sight
Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake
Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court
And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh
And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out
And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings
And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel
Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go
And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had
And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth
And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle
And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph
And the cherubims were lifted up
And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand
This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar
And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood
And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them
And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God
When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them
And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house
Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon
This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims
And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me
Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly
And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence
And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt
And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh
David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king
And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city
And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself
Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity
And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt
So the vision that I had seen went up from me
Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me
And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David
And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept
Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house
And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil
For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day
And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying
And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep
And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name
And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David
and who is the son of Jesse
there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master
So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings
But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them
they were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep
And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them
And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground
Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord
Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols
Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel
For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself
And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me
And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died
And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of her's that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife
But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph
David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed
Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work
or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem
David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish
Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations
Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them
And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all
Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil
I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk
I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck
And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day
And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months
that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them
And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt
And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood
And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day
And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled
And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets
Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy
And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good
because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish
And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD
So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives
And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor
that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand
But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people
Shall he prosper
shall he escape that doeth such things
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives
or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die
Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head
And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel
And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day
to them which were in Beth-el, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir
and to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa
and to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites
and to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach
If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things
and to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together
As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa
And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan
But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die
And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul
All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live
all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there
Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die
And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days
saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live
Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die
So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness
Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it
And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it
And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead
Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude
Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive
And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king
Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die
Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD
Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin
And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price
And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom
Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide
even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great
Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom
And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's
Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants
And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me
And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign
And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains
And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim
He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls
And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands
And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness
And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them
Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them
The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out
And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands
because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols
And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains
Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness
And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz
But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols
I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward
Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries
because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols
And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live
Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass
And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me
And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you
And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God
and I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out
to wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face
and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD
He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant
one sea, and twelve oxen under it
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers
Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out
And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed
And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold
and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold
Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field
Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion
Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month
And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark
And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims
for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt
And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course
also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God
Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness
And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood
Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart
The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel
And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David
But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth
Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built
Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee
Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive
If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house
And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers
When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them
If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD
then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers
Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house
then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name
If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause
If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near
yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly
if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name
then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee
Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain
And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none
Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat
Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt
And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days
And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected
If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people
if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land
Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments
then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel
But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them
then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations
And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built
and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her
And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom
howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard
Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones
And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold
And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days
And the people departed
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day
It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations
And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying
He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me
And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers
And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam
With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah
And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water
He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa
And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine
And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD
and he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon
And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse
which bare him children; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him
And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD
And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers
And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God
for he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves
and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him
Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah
No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them
Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them
And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul
that whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels
And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying
And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand
And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel
And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim
but sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah
Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah
And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people
And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store
And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem
These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them
Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left
Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes
Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman
So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle
if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people
For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head
When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD
Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right
therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD
if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die
None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live
And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city
When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby
and said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment
But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart
Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb
It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi
Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land
And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD
And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court
Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence
And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness
Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not
behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit
And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered
And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children
Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD
Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out
And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD
And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high
I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel
I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD
And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten
And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats
For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another
Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures
and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet
And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle
Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD
therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle
And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about
And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more
And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD
Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel
And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly
and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works
And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish
And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel
And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn
I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD
Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever
Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king
therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day
The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers
Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame
But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come
behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods
For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown
Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians
and they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly
Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it
And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria
and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them
And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick
And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land
But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went
And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber
For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land
So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh
And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them
And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem
And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God
And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God
I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you
And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen
This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded
and a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD
And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by
But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock
The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones
Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God
and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry
And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about
Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them
Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD
And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves
So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there
And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's people
Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars
and join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand
Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in
And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes
And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land
And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword
My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people
And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest
And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters
And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD
For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim
And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD
And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness
And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end
Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again
Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance
But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died
And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house
Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear
And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers
So they executed judgment against Joash
And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess
Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings
And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart
Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father
But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand
And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces
But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil
But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom
And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them
So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah
So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent
According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them
And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria
after that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years
When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither
And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah
Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah
He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did
And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines
And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims
And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly
Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them
Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry
The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred
And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones
And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal
And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men
And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write
And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north
So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God
for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim
Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree
Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus
And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king
But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him
For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD
Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits
Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories
For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not
Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building
And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz
For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me
And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits
But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel
For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits
And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers
The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building
Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done
He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them
Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street
He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about
He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about
He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed
He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed
He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place
Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof
And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east
Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD
And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah
And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me
And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD
Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever
So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar
Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern
And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them
So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns
and the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel
And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof
And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets
And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets
And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished
And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD
And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings
Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel
For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month
For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem
And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves
And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation
So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written
And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see
So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them
Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem
But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD
Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD
they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge
And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within
They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat
And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments
Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads
For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD
Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court
And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people
Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before
And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean
And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced
And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves
So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem
And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days
Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all
They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be their's
Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities
And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD
He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD
Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD
Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof
And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place
And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps
And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers
In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month
And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel
And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel
Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps
Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath
This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley
concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer
and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD
All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary
and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court
And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house
In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered
And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering
After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself
And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem
And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him
In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil
And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying
Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him
Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons
with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles
And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish
And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah
And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah
After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying
And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish
Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem
And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof
But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it
And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah
And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah
Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning
And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man
And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD
And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven
Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering
Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance
After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward
Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side
Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court
In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure
In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign
And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about
But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem
Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah
Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side
And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles
storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks
Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over
Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much
Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other
Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart
Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel
And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many
Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem
But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt
but did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel
And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance
For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran
And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever
So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel
So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel
And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD
And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken
And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon
And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali
And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers
And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Manasseh
And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim
And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city
And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben
And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah
Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only
And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth
His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers
It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray
Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem
And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites
But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them
And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand
and humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more
And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof
And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house
And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred
But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead
And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years
And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left
And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel
All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city
As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion
And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem
And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion
And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about
And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion
And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem
And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion
Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God
And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem
And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea
And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house
This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD
even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed
Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters
And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses
And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed
For do I now persuade men, or God
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes
or do I seek to please men
for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ
And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard
to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood
because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother
Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia
and was unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ
And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book
Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also
But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised
And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God
but contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter
And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers
(for he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham
And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites
that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith
Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment
For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ
And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus
And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise
to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons
So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father
And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days
Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods
And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first
Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD
Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace
and his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth
Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem
This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you
I would they were even cut off which trouble you
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD
For every man shall bear his own burden
Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem
Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see
but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy
And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon
And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia
Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab
Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die
And Elijah departed
And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty
And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty
And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty
And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
And the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble
So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying
And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son
Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel
Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste
And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal
Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways
Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD
Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit
And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God
In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying
And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven
and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land
and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over
And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha
And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying
And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying
And they brought it to him
So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD
And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying
And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth
And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria
God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets
And of the angels he saith,
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made
Who maketh his angels spirits,
But unto the Son he saith,
But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel
A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom
So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them
They shall perish; but thou remainest:
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him
And they all shall wax old as doth a garment
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak
And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water
And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil
Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham
And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted
who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house
Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith,
And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually
To day if ye will hear his voice
And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there
And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life
And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers
When your fathers tempted me, proved me,
And saw my works forty years
And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out
So I sware in my wrath,
They shall not enter into my rest
And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee
Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God
And he arose, and followed her
But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief
He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD
Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it
And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God
Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief
But he said, Then bring meal
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do
And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat
Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession
And there was no harm in the pot
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins
And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife
though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria
and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him
And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel
called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec
Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil
So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God
And this will we do, if God permit
Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost
may I not wash in them, and be clean
and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come
So he turned and went away in a rage
if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God
But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed
that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath
Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham
The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow
For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us
For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law
So he went with them
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar
And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
And he put out his hand, and took it
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament
And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second

Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God
Then Libnah revolted at the same time
partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah

So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise
And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram
God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds

Let brotherly love continue
And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs

Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever

And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel
So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining

And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning

is not Hamath as Arpad
And he took them
is not Samaria as Damascus
And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground

And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest

where are the gods of Sepharvaim
and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done
Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh

So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah
In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish
And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee

And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria

Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying
and walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made
And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city
And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken
And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness
Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God
Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only
Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made
Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts
Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD
To whom then will ye liken God
or what likeness will ye compare unto him
until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets
Have ye not known
So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day
have ye not heard
And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them
hath it not been told you from the beginning
have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
Who among you will give ear to this
And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima
who will hearken and hear for the time to come
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim
Who hath believed our report
So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places
and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed
They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD
with whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them
wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore
Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations
knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience
Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed
He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house
for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was
At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain
And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons
Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him
Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well
But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all
Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only
Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad
where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also
have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand
For in many things we offend all
And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD
If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body
And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah
but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria
My brethren, these things ought not so to be
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar
let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work
Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy
And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace
From whence come wars and fightings among you
And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz
come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members
At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick
And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten
And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord
Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience
Behold, we count them happy which endure
And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying
Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy
Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols
therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did
And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them
and he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD
And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house
But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying
Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people
and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house
unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house
And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book
And Shaphan read it before the king
And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes
And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying
And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read
But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard
And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem
Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love
And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book
therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways
And all the people stood to the covenant
And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people
And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove
Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren
And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech
And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah
And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron
And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved
And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men
How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah
but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem
And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him
Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour
And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre
if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead
Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done
And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not
therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh
And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets
And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim
Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did
and also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah
So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead
For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices
And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt
Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them
yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it
And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon
At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done
And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah
Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel
And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon
And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem
And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about
Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away
But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen
And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon
And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away
And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away
The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door
and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city
and Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah
and the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath
So Judah was carried away out of their land
And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler
And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees
Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good
and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon
and changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life
And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy
And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag
it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him
For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land
and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt
and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him
And he smote him that he died
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it
At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it
if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them
So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite
And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it
And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron
if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them
And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him
But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim
and made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel
And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months
Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David
Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people
And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks
And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill
Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city
And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath
And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim
And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel
But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died
And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem
And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day
For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people
and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife
For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more
These were born to David in Hebron
As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence
And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul
and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans
So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him
And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die
Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture
And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him
Do not I fill heaven and earth
And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal
And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you
And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house
When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace
And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God
therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence
The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon
One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad
And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good
So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle
And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt
And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
the which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying
And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear
And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people
They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words
And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel
Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle
And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled
And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it
Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me
to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people
and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod
And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity
Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon
Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh
and all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years
and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah
and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes
Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you
So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David
And David built round about from Millo and inward
And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him
And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house
And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake
And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David
And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon
The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them
And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim
And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals
And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day
So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness
And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod
So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet
And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD
And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death
And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies
And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying
Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle
Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel
Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime
And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom
He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever
Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon
I will be his father, and he shall be my son
(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon
but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David
And what can David say more unto thee
for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you
For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them
know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity
Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears
thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil
For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes
David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates
Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem
And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet
which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying
of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah
And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah
And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks
And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people
and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers
And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar
For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house
For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes
And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying
And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver
And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances
So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open
Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do
and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison
As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons
And I charged Baruch before them, saying
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet
Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying
Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away
and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror
And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men
and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men
And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field
When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians
and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon
For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him
But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it
And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city
And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence
So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem
And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God
and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them
And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them
So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more
For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying
Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name
For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword
Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth
And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite
And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me
And Joab sent Uriah to David
And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered
For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel
And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet
And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king
Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season
then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers
Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire
And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah
Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were
Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war
that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother
and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king
But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids
and if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight
Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying
knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying
And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate
And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof
the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf
And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband
The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die
And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth
And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them
Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD
And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD
And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city
And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters
And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem
And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it
And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head
When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD
And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance
then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes
Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people
Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man
So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them
And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand
And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother
And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king
Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him
And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth
And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled
Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her
Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them
But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying
And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar
Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned
But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah
Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison
And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded
Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled
And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army
And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left
then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison
When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years
Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead
Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom
Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent
Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
and come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him
Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying
So Joab put the words in her mouth
Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king, saying
So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem
And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face
And Jeremiah did so
So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face
But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him
But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee
So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face
Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live
But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me
Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die
And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him
And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him
And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up
And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron
And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon
And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing
Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah
Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon
And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem
And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over
Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained
And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him
But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time
Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there
Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying
And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head
So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes
unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me
So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem
And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine
And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah
so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David
Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land
Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon
And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there
Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan
and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only
And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel
And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men
Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled
So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead
And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim
And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom
And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim
Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near
For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured
Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us
And Absalom met the servants of David
And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah
And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away
Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest
And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him
Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen
And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land
And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran
But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God
And the watchman cried, and told the king
And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth
then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt, and there ye shall die
And he came apace, and drew near
And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here
And he turned aside, and stood still
And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you
And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son
And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle
And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines
But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah
Then the king arose, and sat in the gate
even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah
And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate
And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house
So the king returned, and came to Jordan
And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan
And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David
And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods
And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan
Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain
Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die
Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem
And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah
And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem
For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence
Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward
Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying
As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee
Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying
So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem
The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind
So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day
Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him
And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri
And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway
And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still
When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri
Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom
And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab
And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent
And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king
Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites
and Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder
and Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests
and Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David
And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul
And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done
and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged
And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded
And after that God was intreated for the land
And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David
And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam
And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul
and he said,
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer
When the waves of death compassed me,
The floods of ungodly men made me afraid
The sorrows of hell compassed me about;
The snares of death prevented me
In my distress I called upon the LORD,
And cried to my God:
And he did hear my voice out of his temple,
And my cry did enter into his ears
And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done
Then the earth shook and trembled;
The foundations of heaven moved
And shook, because he was wroth
And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land
He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
And darkness was under his feet
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him
And he was seen upon the wings of the wind
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah
And he made darkness pavilions round about him,
Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death
Dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies
Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem
Through the brightness before him
and all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about
Were coals of fire kindled
Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude
The LORD thundered from heaven,
But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen
And the Most High uttered his voice
Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon
And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;
The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away
Lightning, and discomfited them
And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away
He sent from above, he took me;
And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow
He drew me out of many waters
And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass
They prevented me in the day of my calamity:
The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these
But the LORD was my stay
And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about
He brought me forth also into a large place:
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door
He delivered me, because he delighted in me
he took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness:
So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah
According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath
For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land
And have not wickedly departed from my God
For all his judgments were before me:
And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them
I was also upright before him,
and spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon
And have kept myself from mine iniquity
and changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,
The same was in the beginning with God
And with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
In him was life; and the life was the light of men
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not
And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John
For thou art my lamp, O LORD:
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light
And the LORD will lighten my darkness
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not
For by thee I have run through a troop:
He came unto his own, and his own received him not
By my God have I leaped over a wall
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ
God is my strength and power:
And he maketh my way perfect
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet:
And setteth me upon my high places
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation:
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees
And thy gentleness hath made me great
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me;
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world
So that my feet did not slip
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples
And turned not again until I had consumed them
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus
And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise:
and both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage
Yea, they are fallen under my feet
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee
For thou hast girded me with strength to battle:
And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
Them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me
But he spake of the temple of his body
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies,
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men
That I might destroy them that hate me
Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again
They looked, but there was none to save;
Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things
Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness
Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life
I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved
Thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen:
For John was not yet cast into prison
A people which I knew not shall serve me
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying
Strangers shall fade away,
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven
And they shall be afraid out of their close places
He must increase, but I must decrease
It is God that avengeth me,
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true
And that bringeth down the people under me
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:
Thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me:
Thou hast delivered me from the violent man
And he must needs go through Samaria
The Spirit of the LORD spake by me,
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again
And his word was in my tongue
The woman answered and said, I have no husband
The God of Israel said,
The Rock of Israel spake to me,
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet
He that ruleth over men must be just,
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father
Ruling in the fear of God
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men
But the man that shall touch them
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him
Must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear;
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee
And they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judæa into Galilee
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years
therefore he would not drink it
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place
These things did these three mighty men
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God
Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite
And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer
then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men
and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying
If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land
There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true
or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth
or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me
And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded
Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not
And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life
after he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei
I receive not honour from men
on this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you
The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me
turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias
And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased
And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples
the LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude
And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh
How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him
So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes
Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea
and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum
And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do
And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them
And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
(howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee
And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe
what dost thou work
and they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out
But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves
Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God
and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life
I am that bread of life
Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead
The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day
Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God
For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed
who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying
These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum
Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before
Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither
But there are some of you that believe not
For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him
From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go
thou hast the words of eternal life
Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah
For neither did his brethren believe in him
And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee
So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught
And the LORD spake unto me, saying
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself
Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him
will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified
which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims
So there was a division among the people because of him
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him
Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived
And we went over the brook Zered
And every man went unto his own house
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives
For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed
they say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act
So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him
that the LORD spake unto me, saying
But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not
Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day
And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground
And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me
(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims
It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true
Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world
Then said they unto him, Who art thou
And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning
And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father
As he spake these words, many believed on him
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever
Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed
And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people
Why do ye not understand my speech
And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain
even because ye cannot hear my word
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took
Which of you convinceth me of sin
From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us
And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me
only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil
Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes
And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day
But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves
Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles
And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon
And there was a division among them
(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind
all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us
And they cast him out
And he said, Lord, I believe
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber
And I gave Gilead unto Machir
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice
the plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them
The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings
And I besought the LORD at that time, saying
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods
If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken
So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor
say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God
Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not
But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand
Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it
And many believed on him there
For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for
And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day
And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness
If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep
And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead
And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already
Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off
lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female
and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died
the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him
But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day
Jesus wept
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid
Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee
And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me
For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him
When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done
And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you
And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell
But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death
When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him
(for the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this
For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death
Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live
because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus
Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle
And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast
to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes
Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else
This he said, signifying what death he should die
Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever
Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rising
namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites
And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him
these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God
from Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me
and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness
The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day
The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
Thou shalt have none other gods before me
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet
Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved
Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it
Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work
And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor
Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
Thou shalt not kill
Neither shalt thou commit adultery
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also
Neither shalt thou steal
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son
Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it
If ye love me, keep my commandments
And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you
Now therefore why should we die
for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die
For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived
And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you
O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever
Abide in me, and I in you
Go say to them, Get you into your tents again
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you
Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples
Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love
that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you
and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might
These things I command you, that ye love one another
And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart
But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up
He that hateth me hateth my Father also
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended
And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not
And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me
and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them
then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name
But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart
Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you
And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment
(for the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth
of sin, because they believe not on me
Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah
of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more
Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee
of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken
He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you
Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me
and the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing
and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you
And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day
At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb
When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe
and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them
as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent
For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was
but because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee
Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them
Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world
Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt
O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me
Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible
As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground
But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him
All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
But Peter stood at the door without
And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no
Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter
And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years
Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee
that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die
Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him
For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe
a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid
When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day
And they took Jesus, and led him away
lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him
then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint
but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid
But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre
Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in
Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people
Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie
and the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself
Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead
and the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home
And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant
and seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain
Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side
So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost
And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came
And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples
And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount
But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus
And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice
As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread
Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise
I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead
And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand
And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters
And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee
to keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked
he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment
Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name
He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen
Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway
and his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land
and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day
and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place
and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it
and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey
For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs
but the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven
And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil
And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them
But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken
and then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you
And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us
Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes
So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah
And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up
Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this
And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates
For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them
that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them
For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him
then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves
There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you
Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah
And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
a blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day
Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly
and a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known
I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal
And he heard me;
Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh
Out of the belly of hell cried I,
And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day
And thou heardest my voice
These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul:
Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree
The depth closed me round about,
and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place
The weeds were wrapped about my head
Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God
and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks
They that observe lying vanities
and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
Forsake their own mercy
Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes
For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you
then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD
and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you
And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land
Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest
And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee
So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey
Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand
For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes
but thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto
Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth
When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry
If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh
But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered
Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water
Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD
Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose
Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God
mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities
Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ
What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it
And of some have compassion, making a difference
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
He hath led me, and brought me
Into darkness, but not into light
It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed,
Because his compassions fail not
He putteth his mouth in the dust;
If so be there may be hope
O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong:
Judge thou my cause
Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us:
Consider, and behold our reproach
Our inheritance is turned to strangers,
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing
Our houses to aliens
These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat
We are orphans and fatherless,
the hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois
Our mothers are as widows
Our fathers have sinned, and are not;
Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you
And we have borne their iniquities
We gat our bread with the peril of our lives
These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat
Because of the sword of the wilderness
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you
Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
Of all clean birds ye shall eat
And forsake us so long time
But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray
But thou hast utterly rejected us;
and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind
Thou art very wroth against us
and every raven after his kind
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind
it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus
the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed
and the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless
and the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat
And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course
And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense
But of all clean fowls ye may eat
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense
Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him
And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth
And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God
then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose
And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house
and the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying
At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be
At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word
Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release
And the angel departed from her
save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda
only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day
and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me
If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother
For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy
but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth
And Mary said,
Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto
My soul doth magnify the Lord
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour
And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee
And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
And holy is his name
And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee
And his mercy is on them that fear him
From generation to generation
He hath shewed strength with his arm;
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts
He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night
And exalted them of low degree
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there
He hath filled the hungry with good things;
Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life
And the rich he hath sent empty away
And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning
He hath holpen his servant Israel,
Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
In remembrance of his mercy
but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son
And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her
Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called
Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn
And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa
and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there
And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes
And the hand of the Lord was with him
Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;
For he hath visited and redeemed his people
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us
every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee
In the house of his servant David
Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began
That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,
Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee
And to remember his holy covenant
Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant
Might serve him without fear
and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
By the remission of their sins
The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people
And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed
So thou shalt put the evil away from among you
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city
If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment
to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered
according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night
And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously
When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me
And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds
Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold
But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart
And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them
and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ
The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance
then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said
Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw
According to thy word
The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people
For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever
And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth
They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover
There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast
or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer
And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers
Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them
For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do
as it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying,
The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken
Make his paths straight
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him
Every valley shall be filled,
And every mountain and hill shall be brought low;
And the crooked shall be made straight,
When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses
And the rough ways shall be made smooth
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people
Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither
But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done
And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past
added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past
And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee
And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season
And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers
And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee
And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written
But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die
Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it
If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong
And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down
then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days
And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother
And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country
And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath
And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong
And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot
But he passing through the midst of them went his way
When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power
And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people
And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice
And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about
let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it
And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it
let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee
And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret
and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets
And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted
And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land
And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship
And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake
For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken
And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him
And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean
And immediately his leprosy was cleansed
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts
But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth
but thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee
And he left all, rose up, and followed him
But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved
only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands
But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst
And he arose and stood forth
Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil
And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand
And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other
And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus
Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon called Zelotes
and Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all
But woe unto you that are rich
for ye have received your consolation
Woe unto you that are full
then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn
for ye shall hunger
If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them
Woe unto you that laugh now
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place
for ye shall mourn and weep
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you
bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you
And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise
For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye
Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother
for sinners also love those that love them
And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye
Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again
for sinners also do even the same
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye
for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again
but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people
But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel
And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak
And he delivered him to his mother
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judæa, and throughout all the region round about

lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood
And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant
Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow
And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law
so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it
(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem
Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt
And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace
And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee
but now they are hid from thine eyes
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought
If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers
And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live
and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him
And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee
and spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things
And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day
And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty
So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul
What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them
For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off
But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it
And last of all the woman died also
See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil
And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage
but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage
But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all
I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it
And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel
And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites
And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all
And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be
And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you
Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom
And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
And it shall turn to you for a testimony
And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel
Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer
And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death
Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake
But there shall not an hair of your head perish
And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh
Then let them which are in Judæa flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto
And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods
For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled
Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days
For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel
men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory
And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished
And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees
that Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying
when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away
Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people
And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them
And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money
My doctrine shall drop as the rain,
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed
My speech shall distil as the dew,
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him
As the small rain upon the tender herb,
And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer
And as the showers upon the grass
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves
Because I will publish the name of the LORD:
But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table
Ascribe ye greatness unto our God
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest
Do ye thus requite the LORD,
O foolish people and unwise
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
Is not he thy father that hath bought thee
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me
Hath he not made thee, and established thee
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel
For the LORD's portion is his people;
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him
He found him in a desert land,
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
And in the waste howling wilderness;
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow
He led him about, he instructed him,
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear
He kept him as the apple of his eye
And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far
As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
And he touched his ear, and healed him
Fluttereth over her young,
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves
Spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house
Beareth them on her wings
And Peter followed afar off
So the LORD alone did lead him,
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest
And there was no strange god with him
And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew
He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter
That he might eat the increase of the fields;
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly
And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him
And oil out of the flinty rock
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him
Butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
With fat of lambs,
And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go
With the fat of kidneys of wheat;
And they said, What need we any further witness
And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing
Thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness;
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him
Then he forsook God which made him,
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves
And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them
And hast forgotten God that formed thee
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified
And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them,
And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed
Because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
And he said, I will hide my face from them,
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death
I will see what their end shall be:
For they are a very froward generation,
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour
Children in whom is no faith
For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned
And shall burn unto the lowest hell,
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things
And shall consume the earth with her increase,
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just
And set on fire the foundations of the mountains
This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus
I will heap mischiefs upon them;
Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them
I will spend mine arrows upon them
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
I said, I would scatter them into corners,
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus
I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men
And they remembered his words
and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not
And they talked together of all these things which had happened
For they are a nation void of counsel,
And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them
Neither is there any understanding in them
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him
O that they were wise, that they understood this,
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken
That they would consider their latter end
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
For their rock is not as our Rock,
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further
Even our enemies themselves being judges
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
And he went in to tarry with them
And of the fields of Gomorrah:
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread
Their grapes are grapes of gall,
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit
Their clusters are bitter
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet
Their wine is the poison of dragons,
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb
And the cruel venom of asps
And he took it, and did eat before them
Is not this laid up in store with me,
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures
And sealed up among my treasures
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day
For the LORD shall judge his people,
And repent himself for his servants,
And ye are witnesses of these things
When he seeth that their power is gone,
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them
And there is none shut up, or left
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven
And he shall say, Where are their gods,
The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi
Their rock in whom they trusted
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
And drank the wine of their drink offerings
Let them rise up and help you,
And be your protection
See now that I, even I, am he,
And there is no god with me:
And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you
I kill, and I make alive;
I wound, and I heal:
Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it
Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name
For I lift up my hand to heaven,
And say, I live for ever
For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts
If I whet my glittering sword,
Have we not all one father
And mine hand take hold on judgment;
hath not one God created us
I will render vengeance to mine enemies,
why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers
And will reward them that hate me
The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts
And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun
But who may abide the day of his coming
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel
and who shall stand when he appeareth
and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law
for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession
and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people
For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel
And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death
The LORD came from Sinai,
Will a man rob God
And rose up from Seir unto them;
Yet ye have robbed me
He shined forth from mount Paran,
But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee
And he came with ten thousands of saints:
In tithes and offerings
From his right hand went a fiery law for them
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation
Yea, he loved the people;
All his saints are in thy hand:
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts
And they sat down at thy feet;
Every one shall receive of thy words
And he was king in Jeshurun,
When the heads of the people
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments
And the tribes of Israel were gathered together
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments,
And Israel thy law:
They shall put incense before thee,
And whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations
And of Joseph he said,
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
Blessed of the LORD be his land,
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying
For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
And for the deep that coucheth beneath
And they shall call his name Emmanuel,
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,
which being interpreted is, God with us
And for the precious things put forth by the moon
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife
And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born
And for the precious things of the lasting hills
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judæa: for thus it is written by the prophet
And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared
And for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:
When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt
Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph,
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying
And upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
And of Zebulun he said,
And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel
Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region round about Jordan
And, Issachar, in thy tents
and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins
And of Gad he said,
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance
Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him
He dwelleth as a lion,
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
And teareth the arm with the crown of the head
Then he suffered him
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers
And of Asher he said,
And they straightway left their nets, and followed him
Let Asher be blessed with children;
And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him
Let him be acceptable to his brethren,
And let him dip his foot in oil
And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan
Thy shoes shall be iron and brass;
And as thy days, so shall thy strength be
and he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun,
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake
Who rideth upon the heaven in thy help,
And in his excellency on the sky
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled
The eternal God is thy refuge,
And underneath are the everlasting arms:
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee
And he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;
leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift
And shall say, Destroy them
Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison
and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea
Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar
but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD
And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain
in all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land
and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem
do not even the publicans the same
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him
Thy kingdom come
Give us this day our daily bread
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you
Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on
This is also vanity
There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them
This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God
Are ye not much better than they
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I
and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it
I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
Ye shall know them by their fruits
Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
This is also vanity and vexation of spirit
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock
and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand
And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes
Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished
When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead
And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side
Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he
And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other
And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts
And he arose, and departed to his house
For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them
but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast
And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole
And the woman was made whole from that hour
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses
nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat
And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet
But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt
But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil
For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you
but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven
But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household
And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me
And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities
Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see
the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them
And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see
behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not
But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you
Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue
And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand
And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other
Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him
and charged them that they should not make him known
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying
He shall not strive, nor cry;
Neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad
O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things
for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here
The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd
But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren
The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore
that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace
in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him
and when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days
and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace
but other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold
He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given
And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand
And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on
And seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive
But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment
For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them
and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus
But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it
yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people
but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way
After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her
But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite
He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away
The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it
and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her
then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls
And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus
After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai
And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased
And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy
And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me
and came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth
and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free
Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition
So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her
Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying
Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not
This people honoureth me with their lips,
Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was
But their heart is far from me
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man
And they told to Mordecai Esther's words
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him
insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude
Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala
On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king
And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring
And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus
O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me
let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart
And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things
Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist
Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water
Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was
Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house
As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face
And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men
Peter saith unto him, Of strangers
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai
Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free
Then was the king's wrath pacified
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
and said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost
And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries
Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven
wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt
So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done
And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day
And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan
And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them
And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there
Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them
And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence
And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them
He saith unto him, Which
For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater
Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness
Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel
And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard
On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny
on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them
Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren
And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them
to stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him
And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them
Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there
the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered
and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it
Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another
And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise
to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him
And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them
And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said
And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son
Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah
and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city
Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment
And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already
and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment
And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation
And he was speechless
And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph
Shew me the tribute money
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we
And they brought unto him a penny
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah
And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine
And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying
This is the first and great commandment
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink
The LORD said unto my Lord,
And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go
saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat
And the maid went and called the child's mother
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues
And the woman took the child, and nursed it
and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi
And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand
But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren
Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites
for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon
And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein
And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon
for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob
And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them
for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them
And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you
All these are the beginning of sorrows
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved
then let them which be in Judæa flee into the mountains
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt
let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out of his house
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand
And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not
And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go
Behold, I have told you before
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail
And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand
But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come
Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming
And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps
And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods
And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two
And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money
And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying
Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves
And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw
for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples
So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas
and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste
And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task
And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests
and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you
And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD
And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve
And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it
And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee
Likewise also said all the disciples
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour
And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy
And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words
And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come
And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites
Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him
These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies
And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear
These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels
And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled
And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet
Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt
but found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none
At the last came two false witnesses
Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man
And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh
And immediately the cock crew
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice
And he went out, and wept bitterly
When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death
and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor
And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go
And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself
Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood
Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you
And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him
And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me
And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt
And sitting down they watched him there
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said
And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast
and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me
among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple
And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre
In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow
And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one
And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me
And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail
For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still
And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him
behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain
Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done
And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel
And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers
saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept
And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth
For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth
As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go
Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now
He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses
and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field
So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail
And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled
But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me
let my people go, that they may serve me
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you
And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go
And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days
O my people, what have I done unto thee
And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God
and wherein have I wearied thee
testify against me
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go
And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts
And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying
This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you
and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening
And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it
And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof
And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God
John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan
And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him
And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they
And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness
And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle
Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God
And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers
And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him
And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him
And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee
It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations
But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her
And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat thereof
And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils
but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof
And all the city was gathered together at the door
A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed
In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils
And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed
Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they
And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away
And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies
And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts
But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month
And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath
Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD
And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters
And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him
For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues
And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt
And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach
Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year
and to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee
and Simon he surnamed Peter
and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus, and Simon the Canaanite
And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread
And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this
And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself
that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage
And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand
And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand
And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end
Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness
because they said, He hath an unclean spirit
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night
And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren
he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people
and it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up
but when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea
And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable
The sower soweth the word
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him
and not to be set on a candlestick
and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them
For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground
But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon
and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth
And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it
wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still
And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm
And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me
And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes
speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward
And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
but lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen
But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding
And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country
And they went out to see what it was that was done
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen
And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians
And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years
and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them
when she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment
But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore
But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth
And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses
And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly
The people shall hear, and be afraid:
Sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina
And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him
And he marvelled because of their unbelief
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances
And he went round about the villages, teaching
And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them
And they went out, and preached that men should repent
And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters
Others said, That it is Elias
And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb
And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed
And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass
And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties
And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
And they did all eat, and were filled
And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people
And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray
And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning
But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out
And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted
And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore
And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders
He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,
And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws
So the people rested on the seventh day
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey
And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition
but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept
And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand
And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan
And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable
And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also
Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him
And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders
thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness
And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat
So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha
Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf
So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill
And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed
But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun
And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul
When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt
And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them
then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus
and her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves
and Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him
And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him
And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them
And he said, Of a child
And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose
And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God
But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening
But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me
For he that is not against us is on our part
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God
And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched
And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good
and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do
For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt
Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens
And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife
So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens
And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her
And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God
In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them
For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount
And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel
ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself
And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him
And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's
and be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John
And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes
and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled
And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount
And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way
And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry
and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple
And when even was come, he went out of the city
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots
And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses
So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them
And God spake all these words, saying
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
Thou shalt have no other gods before me
And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth
And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled
And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard
and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments
What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy
And have ye not read this scripture;
Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work
The stone which the builders rejected
Is become the head of the corner
Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not steal
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God
And no man after that durst ask him any question
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David
And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was
And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven
Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold
Sit thou on my right hand,
David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son
And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it
And the common people heard him gladly
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts
Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing
If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him
And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury
If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself
Tell us, when shall these things be
And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free
And the gospel must first be published among all nations
And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do
But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost
If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her
and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house
And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment
If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish
And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter
He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death
And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death
But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things
And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death
And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death
And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed
And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven
And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished
Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money
If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is
And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe
After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death
And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake
And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made
And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake
And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her
she hath wrought a good work on me
But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them
If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him
Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him
If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve
And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein
And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish
the owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his
And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives
Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own
And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him
If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep
And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou
If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him
couldest not thou watch one hour
If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double
And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words
If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution
And they laid their hands on him, and took him
If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution
If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me
If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods
And they all forsook him, and fled
And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him
If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it
and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good
For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together
And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof
And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying
If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn
But neither so did their witness agree together
And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good
And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest
And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest
If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins
And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
And the second time the cock crew
Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death
And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice
He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed
And when he thought thereon, he wept
Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing
Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child
If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled
and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired
If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them
If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy
Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them
And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band
And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not
neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him
If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again
And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left
If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him
Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save
Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe
And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous
And they that were crucified with him reviled him
Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt
And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom
Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed
And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him
Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept
Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them
Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared
And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues
But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God
For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off
And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee
By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land
Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods
And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD
And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar
Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel
And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink
And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God
And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount
And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair
and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood
oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense
onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate
And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it
And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold
And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them
The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it
And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee
And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat
And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be
And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee
grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about
And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof
whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels
Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself
And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them
There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus
And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you
And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same
always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now
three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick
being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ
And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick
so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places
Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold
and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear
And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain
Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels
nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith
Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them
that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again
The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies
The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another
fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind
And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others
Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus
And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make
Do all things without murmurings and disputings
The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure
holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me
And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's
And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one
But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel
And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly
And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins
I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful
And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh
If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more
concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless
And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward
if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead
And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing
And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample
and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards
who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself
And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides
I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord
And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things
And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you
And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity
And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever
And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount
And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made
who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw
and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth
And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place
Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood
And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me
And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework
And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire
and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead
And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof
And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last
And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar
Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter
And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks
And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it
and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted
Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love
and the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate
And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive
And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges
The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate
And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass
And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four
I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first
All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come
All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations
And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons
And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent
And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office
If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth
And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see
And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne
And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald
And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle
six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals
And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon
And thou shalt make ouches of gold
And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon
and two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne
Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood
And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond
and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind
And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains
And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold
and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb
And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate
And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate
And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it
And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward
And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod
And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod
And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually
And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue
And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about
a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes
And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD
And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be
And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound
And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty
And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters
And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach
And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon
One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them
By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt
neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven
And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar
These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth
And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves
The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly
And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God
and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons
If any man have an ear, let him hear
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins
These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth
These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb
Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God
The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped
And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory

and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever

And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire
And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal

And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great
And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel
I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns
Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition
The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues
For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels
the merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble
And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony
and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men
and the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing
and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot
And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy
And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army
See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire
to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass
This is the second death
and in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son
and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God
and the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office
on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof
And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant
The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald
And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God
the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof
And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it
And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play
and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves
And I John saw these things, and heard them
And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people
And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand
And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people
And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people
(which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
by whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name
And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables
among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ
And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers
making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you
For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established
And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also
And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book
because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them
And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made
because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools
and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient
And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments
without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful
And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things
And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God
And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God
And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle
Who will render to every man according to his deeds
And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses
to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door
but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend
tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile
And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle
but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile
And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me
for there is no respect of persons with God
Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight
(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves
Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God
And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence
and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law
For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness
is it not in that thou goest with us
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
What advantage then hath the Jew
or what profit is there of circumcision
And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock
and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by
Their throat is an open sepulchre;
With their tongues they have used deceit;
And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest
The poison of asps is under their lips
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD
Their feet are swift to shed blood
And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth
Destruction and misery are in their ways
And the way of peace have they not known
And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin
for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law
but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised
Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end
he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God
Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel
and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience
And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement
And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face
(for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him
that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them
What shall we say then
Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound
and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death
and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
and oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense
knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin
and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate
For he that is dead is freed from sin
And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him
the tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets
knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him
the ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God
the table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord
the candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God
and the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace
the altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot
What then
the hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court
shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace
the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness
And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments
And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered an offering of gold unto the LORD
And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband
And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen
And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair
And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate
For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died
and spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense
And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah
Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good
and he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship
Was then that which is good made death unto me
and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass
God forbid
and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work
But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan
For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin
For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I
Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good
And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
and they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal
For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do
And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me
And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made
I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man
For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much
but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them
The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size
And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit
Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death
And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit
And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be
And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God
And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh
And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God
And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God
And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God
And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward
because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God
and forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now
And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it
and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect
And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets
For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel
And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault
And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other
As he saith also in Osee,
I will call them my people, which were not my people;
And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work
And her beloved, which was not beloved
And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework
What shall we say then
and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass
That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge
And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them
And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark
And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat
one cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard
Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about
and how shall they hear without a preacher
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof
Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table
I say then, Hath God cast away his people
And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold
God forbid
And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same
For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin
and six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof
But what saith the answer of God unto him
three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace
And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers
and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it
Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold
What then
And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold
Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof
And David saith,
And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about
Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal
And a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold
And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary
And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass
if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them
And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it
boast not against the branches
And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves
But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee
And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again
And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance
even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all
And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver
And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver
And for the east side eastward fifty cubits
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office
so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another
All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen
distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not
And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men
And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour
And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar
and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about
And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work
They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together
And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living
And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
But why dost thou judge thy brother
And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen
or why dost thou set at nought thy brother
It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled
for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ
And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God
And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way
Let not then your good be evil spoken of
And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold
For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men
And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate
For meat destroy not the work of God
And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it
All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak
And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod
And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves
And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification
And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend
And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus
And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God
And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
and a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen
and a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses
And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another
and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God
the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you
the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
the pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints
and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door
the brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain
the cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ
According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me
And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them
that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Now the God of peace be with you all
On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord
Salute Apelles approved in Christ
And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle
Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household
And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord
And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate
Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord
And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy
Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them
And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy
Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them
And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it
Salute one another with an holy kiss
And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water
The churches of Christ salute you
And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats
I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord
Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he
And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up
And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars
The song of songs, which is Solomon's
And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses
For thy love is better than wine
And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail
He brought me to the banqueting house,
And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses
And his banner over me was love
And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward
His left hand is under my head,
And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses
And his right hand doth embrace me
And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail
My beloved is mine, and I am his:
and he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses
He feedeth among the lilies
And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle
And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses
And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal
Thou art all fair, my love;
And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat
There is no spot in thee
when they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse
And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate
How much better is thy love than wine
So Moses finished the work
And the smell of thine ointments than all spices
Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle
O thou fairest among women
And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys
What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
but if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up
That thou dost so charge us
For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys
My beloved is white and ruddy,
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying
The chiefest among ten thousand
Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem
And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered
Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods
Or ever I was aware,
even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah
My soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib
This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
And thy breasts to clusters of grapes
which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah
The number of the men of the people of Israel
The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two
His left hand should be under my head,
And his right hand should embrace me
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five
Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand,
The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore
And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred
The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two
if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly
The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and three
Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith
The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and six
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work
The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three
to speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men
The children of Jorah, an hundred and twelve
But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared
The children of Hashum, two hundred twenty and three
The children of Gibbar, ninety and five
The children of Beth-lehem, an hundred twenty and three
The men of Netophah, fifty and six
The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight
Your fathers, where are they
and the prophets, do they live for ever
The children of Kirjath-arim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three
Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying
The children of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one
The men of Michmas, an hundred twenty and two
And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words
The men of Beth-el and Ai, two hundred twenty and three
The children of Nebo, fifty and two
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns
The children of Magbish, an hundred fifty and six
And the LORD shewed me four carpenters
I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand
The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty
And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him
The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five
The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five
And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel
And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying
And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep
and said unto me, What seest thou
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll
And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah
And he said, This is wickedness
And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof
All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred ninety and two
the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying
Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah
then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest
And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you
And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place
And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu
when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD
And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem
Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying
Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me
And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying
They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother
and afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear
They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts
Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not
and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia
These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates
And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem
And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying
Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities
then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites
Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter
And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock
Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings
And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock
Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king
Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me
And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people
The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me
And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear
So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them
Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me
And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD
Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel
Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter
The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah
The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king
In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon
We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God
Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon
Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark
but it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light
And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence
Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered
And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail
And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons
Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this
And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague
Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles
And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel
And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses
And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month
And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat
and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah
the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub
the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth
the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki
the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest
And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments
Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel
Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time
I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand
and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem
that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem
And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God
The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem
And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house
And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily
Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons
Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them
And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not
And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment
Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem
and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes
And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me
Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males
Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males
Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males
And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males
And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males
Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males
And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males
And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males
And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males
And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males
Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males
Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding
And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God
And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen
and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty
also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them
and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered
So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days
by number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time
And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God
And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage
For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem
should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations
wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem
and that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away
And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel
And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month
And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night
And the evening and the morning were the first day
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so
And God called the firmament Heaven
And the evening and the morning were the second day
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so
And the evening and the morning were the third day
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold
and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria
And the fourth river is Euphrates
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof
and the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die
And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them
therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth
and why is thy countenance fallen
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted
and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him
And he said, What hast thou done
the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground
And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold
And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech
And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ
male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created
And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth
and the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters
and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died
And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos
and Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died
And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan
and Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died
And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel
and Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died
And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared
and Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died
And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch
and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died
And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah
and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years
and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him
And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech
and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters
and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died
And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth
And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose
And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD
And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence
And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee
And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female
Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive
Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he
And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth
there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah
And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen
And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made
and he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark
and the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more
And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried
And God spake unto Noah, saying
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him
every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered
But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat
And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you
and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud
and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh
These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without
And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him
And he said,
Blessed be the LORD God of Shem;
And Canaan shall be his servant
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city
and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city
and Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah
and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber
and Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg
and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu
and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug
and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor
and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah
and Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees
But Sarai was barren; she had no child
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran
Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee
And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came
And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh
And the Canaanite was then in the land
And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south
And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon
therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive
And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house
And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me
why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south
And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom
But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward
for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations
that these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar
All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim
and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness
And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way
And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness
And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age
And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates
the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites
And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee
And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael
And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect
And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying
As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations
This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham
And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him
And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son
And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him
And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day
and said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant
let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do
seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter
And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him
and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly
But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides
son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city
But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven
and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD
and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father
And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake
And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife
And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children
For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him
And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son
And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs
And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child
And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt
And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away
And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them
And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time
and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son
that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah
And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan
And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth
And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh
and I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter
And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water
Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not
And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD
And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things
And he said, I am Abraham's servant
And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house
and she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son
And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way
And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel
And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done
Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus
And she went to enquire of the LORD
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham
And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great
for he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him
For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there
And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water
And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite
which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death
now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son
And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man
And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven,
And the fatness of the earth,
And plenty of corn and wine
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who
where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran
and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan
Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother
And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people
And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother
When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram
and Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father
And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran
And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it
And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on
so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them
And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother
And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house
And he told Laban all these things
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh
And he abode with him the space of a month
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid
And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son
And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah
Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes
And he lay with her that night
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb
And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons
And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods
And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink
But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before
and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan
And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not
Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them
And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not
This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar
And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day
and Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee
this heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands
two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank
And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men
And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids
And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me
Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough
And he urged him, and he took it
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money
And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel
And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done
And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister
and they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised
then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised
Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister
They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field
and all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him
And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar
And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite
and Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel
And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob
For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir
These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes
And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead
And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead
And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead
And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead
duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon
duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him
And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem
And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him
And his brethren were content
And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes
And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood
And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days
And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard
And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her
And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan
And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him
And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep
And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife
When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face
And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood
And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not
And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son
And he knew her again no more
And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb
And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first
And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian
And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat
And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand
And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her
And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth
And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home
And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled
But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper
And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days
But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand
but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears
And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker
and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river
and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow
and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good
and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them
The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On
And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt
And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him
And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended
And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies
hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither
And he put them all together into ward three days
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God
if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses
And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth
The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies
And the famine was sore in the land
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food
And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones
take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man
And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph
And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house
And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house
And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth
And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians
And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth
And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken
As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses
And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good
And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words
And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words
God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack
And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord
And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons
and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since
Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard
Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life
For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest
And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance
And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come
To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment
And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way
And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father
And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived
his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt
These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three
And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him
These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen
All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six
And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me
And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded
And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house
And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof
Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance
And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head
And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;
And hearken unto Israel your father
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel;
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;
Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch
Simeon and Levi are brethren;
Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations
O my soul, come not thou into their secret;
Unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:
For in their anger they slew a man,
And in their selfwill they digged down a wall
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
And their wrath, for it was cruel:
I will divide them in Jacob,
And scatter them in Israel
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
Nor a lawgiver from between his feet,
Until Shiloh come;
And unto him shall the gathering of the people be
His eyes shall be red with wine,
And his teeth white with milk
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;
And he shall be for an haven of ships;
And his border shall be unto Zidon
Issachar is a strong ass
Couching down between two burdens
And he saw that rest was good,
And the land that it was pleasant;
And bowed his shoulder to bear,
And became a servant unto tribute
Dan shall judge his people,
As one of the tribes of Israel
Gad, a troop shall overcome him:
But he shall overcome at the last
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,
And he shall yield royal dainties
Naphtali is a hind let loose:
He giveth goodly words
Joseph is a fruitful bough,
Even a fruitful bough by a well;
Whose branches run over the wall
The archers have sorely grieved him,
And shot at him, and hated him
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee;
And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee
With blessings of heaven above,
Blessings of the deep that lieth under,
Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb
The blessings of thy father
Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors
Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:
They shall be on the head of Joseph,
And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people
And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying
and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees
And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot
So Simeon went with him
And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites
And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley
And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife
And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people
Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof
And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron
And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day
And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them
Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land
And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out
Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them
Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries
Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob
but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out
Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley
but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries
And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward
And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept
And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD
And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land
And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash
And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim
And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth
Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice
I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died
Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua
Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof
namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath
And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses
And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves
And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD
So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years
And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present
And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly
Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them
And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath
And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel
And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time
And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment
And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun
And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman
And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh
And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor
And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel
And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan
Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying
Praise ye the LORD
For the avenging of Israel,
When the people willingly offered themselves
In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,
And the travellers walked through byways
They chose new gods;
Then was war in the gates:
Was there a shield or spear seen
Among forty thousand in Israel
My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
That offered themselves willingly among the people
Bless ye the LORD
Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek;
After thee, Benjamin, among thy people;
Out of Machir came down governors,
And out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer
And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
Even Issachar, and also Barak:
He was sent on foot into the valley
For the divisions of Reuben
There were great thoughts of heart
Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds,
To hear the bleatings of the flocks
For the divisions of Reuben
There were great searchings of heart
Gilead abode beyond Jordan:
And why did Dan remain in ships
Asher continued on the sea shore,
And abode in his breaches
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death
In the high places of the field
They fought from heaven;
The stars in their courses fought against Sisera
The river of Kishon swept them away,
That ancient river, the river Kishon
O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength
Then were the horsehoofs broken
By the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones
Blessed above women shall Jael
The wife of Heber the Kenite be,
Blessed shall she be above women in the tent
He asked water, and she gave him milk;
She brought forth butter in a lordly dish
She put her hand to the nail,
And her right hand to the workmen's hammer;
And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
When she had pierced and stricken through his temples
Her wise ladies answered her,
Yea, she returned answer to herself
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years
And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them
And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites
And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me
And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth
And he did so
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him
And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said
Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley
Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead
And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand
And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand
But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host
and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host
Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host
And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude
And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers
And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites
And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you
Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that
And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them
And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure
And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host
And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up
And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth
And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city
And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them
But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth
Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength
And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks
And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey
(For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites
And they answered, We will willingly give them
And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey
And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks
Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more
And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon
And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house
And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives
And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech
And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites
And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side
neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel
And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying
And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem
Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian
and ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)
if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you
When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel
then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech
that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren
And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled
And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee
Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field
And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies
And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait
And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech
And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them
And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt
And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith
And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together
Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it
And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull
Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him
And his young man thrust him through, and he died
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place
Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren
And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir
And Jair died, and was buried in Camon
And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more
And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel
And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob
And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon
and said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon
but when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh
And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan
So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it
Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess
So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess
And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab
did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them
Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him
And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands
So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands
And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year
And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands
then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right
Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand
And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel
Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem
And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years
And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun
And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel
And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son
Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing
And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her
And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass
And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware
And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol
And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well
And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him
And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments
But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend
Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi
And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith
And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them
And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death
And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson
And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself
And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him
Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven
Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport
And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah
And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah
And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war
And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah
And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him
And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate
And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war
So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them
And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan
And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house
And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first
And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land
And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again
And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee
And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them
Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light
And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold
And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel
And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man
And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you
Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel
But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel
but the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel
And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah
And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men
And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day
And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day
And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword
And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah
And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times
And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah
Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city
But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven
And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them
Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising
And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour
So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour
But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day
For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there
And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan
And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them
And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel
And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel
Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards
and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin
In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side
thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house
and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh
In all this did not Job sin with his lips
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day
Let that day be darkness;
Let not God regard it from above,
Neither let the light shine upon it
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;
Let a cloud dwell upon it;
Let the blackness of the day terrify it
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it;
Let it not be joined unto the days of the year,
Let it not come into the number of the months
Lo, let that night be solitary,
Let no joyful voice come therein
Let them curse it that curse the day,
Who are ready to raise up their mourning
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb,
Nor hid sorrow from mine eyes
For now should I have lain still and been quiet,
With kings and counsellors of the earth,
Which built desolate places for themselves
Or with princes that had gold,
Who filled their houses with silver
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;
As infants which never saw light
There the wicked cease from troubling;
And there the weary be at rest
There the prisoners rest together;
They hear not the voice of the oppressor
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
And life unto the bitter in soul
Which long for death, but it cometh not;
And dig for it more than for hid treasures
Which rejoice exceedingly,
And are glad, when they can find the grave
For my sighing cometh before I eat,
And my roarings are poured out like the waters
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me,
And that which I was afraid of is come unto me
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved
But who can withhold himself from speaking
Behold, thou hast instructed many,
And thou hast strengthened the weak hands
Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest;
It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent
Or where were the righteous cut off
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
And sow wickedness, reap the same
By the blast of God they perish,
And by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
And the teeth of the young lions, are broken
Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
And mine ear received a little thereof
In thoughts from the visions of the night,
When deep sleep falleth on men
Fear came upon me, and trembling,
Which made all my bones to shake
Then a spirit passed before my face;
The hair of my flesh stood up
It stood still,
But I could not discern the form thereof:
An image was before mine eyes,
There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying
Shall mortal man be more just than God
Shall a man be more pure than his maker
Behold, he put no trust in his servants;
And his angels he charged with folly
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay,
Whose foundation is in the dust,
Which are crushed before the moth
They are destroyed from morning to evening:
They perish for ever without any regarding it
For wrath killeth the foolish man,
And envy slayeth the silly one
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
And taketh it even out of the thorns,
And the robber swalloweth up their substance
Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,
Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground
I would seek unto God,
And unto God would I commit my cause
Which doeth great things and unsearchable;
Marvellous things without number
Who giveth rain upon the earth,
And sendeth waters upon the fields
To set up on high those that be low;
That those which mourn may be exalted to safety
He disappointeth the devices of the crafty,
So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness:
And the counsel of the froward is carried headlong
They meet with darkness in the daytime,
And grope in the noonday as in the night
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth,
And from the hand of the mighty
Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:
Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:
He woundeth, and his hands make whole
He shall deliver thee in six troubles:
Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee
In famine he shall redeem thee from death:
And in war from the power of the sword
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:
Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh:
Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field:
And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace;
And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin
Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
And thine offspring as the grass of the earth
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
Therefore my words are swallowed up
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
The poison whereof drinketh up my spirit:
The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass
Or loweth the ox over his fodder
Oh that I might have my request;
And that God would grant me the thing that I long for
Even that it would please God to destroy me;
That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off
What is my strength, that I should hope
And what is mine end, that I should prolong my life
Is my strength the strength of stones
Or is my flesh of brass
Is not my help in me
And is wisdom driven quite from me
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend;
But he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty
Which are blackish by reason of the ice,
And wherein the snow is hid
What time they wax warm, they vanish:
When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place
The paths of their way are turned aside;
They go to nothing, and perish
The troops of Tema looked,
The companies of Sheba waited for them
They were confounded because they had hoped;
They came thither, and were ashamed
For now ye are nothing;
Ye see my casting down, and are afraid
Did I say, Bring unto me
Or, Give a reward for me of your substance
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue:
And cause me to understand wherein I have erred
How forcible are right words
But what doth your arguing reprove
Do ye imagine to reprove words,
And the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind
Now therefore be content, look upon me;
For it is evident unto you if I lie
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity;
Yea, return again, my righteousness is in it
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth
Are not his days also like the days of an hireling
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow,
And as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work
So am I made to possess months of vanity,
And wearisome nights are appointed to me
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
And are spent without hope
O remember that my life is wind:
Mine eye shall no more see good
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more:
Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away:
So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul
When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
My couch shall ease my complaint
Then thou scarest me with dreams,
And terrifiest me through visions
So that my soul chooseth strangling,
And death rather than my life
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him
And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
And try him every moment
How long wilt thou not depart from me,
Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said
How long wilt thou speak these things
And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind
Doth God pervert judgment
Or doth the Almighty pervert justice
If thy children have sinned against him,
And he have cast them away for their transgression
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes,
And make thy supplication to the Almighty
Though thy beginning was small,
Yet thy latter end should greatly increase
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age,
And prepare thyself to the search of their fathers
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,
Because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,
And utter words out of their heart
Can the rush grow up without mire
Can the flag grow without water
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down,
It withereth before any other herb
So are the paths of all that forget God;
And the hypocrite's hope shall perish
Whose hope shall be cut off,
And whose trust shall be a spider's web
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:
He shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure
He is green before the sun,
And his branch shooteth forth in his garden
Behold, this is the joy of his way,
And out of the earth shall others grow
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,
Neither will he help the evil doers
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing,
And thy lips with rejoicing
But Job answered and said
I know it is so of a truth:
But how should man be just with God
If he will contend with him,
He cannot answer him one of a thousand
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
Who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not:
Which overturneth them in his anger
Which shaketh the earth out of her place,
And the pillars thereof tremble
And sealeth up the stars
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens,
And treadeth upon the waves of the sea
Which doeth great things past finding out;
Yea, and wonders without number
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
He passeth on also, but I perceive him not
If God will not withdraw his anger,
The proud helpers do stoop under him
How much less shall I answer him,
And choose out my words to reason with him
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer,
But I would make supplication to my judge
If I had called, and he had answered me;
Yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice
For he breaketh me with a tempest,
And multiplieth my wounds without cause
He will not suffer me to take my breath,
But filleth me with bitterness
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong:
And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead
If the scourge slay suddenly,
He will laugh at the trial of the innocent
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:
He covereth the faces of the judges thereof;
If not, where, and who is he
Now my days are swifter than a post:
They flee away, they see no good
They are passed away as the swift ships:
As the eagle that hasteth to the prey
I am afraid of all my sorrows,
I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent
If I be wicked,
Why then labour I in vain
If I wash myself with snow water,
And make my hands never so clean
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch,
And mine own clothes shall abhor me
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,
That might lay his hand upon us both
Then would I speak, and not fear him;
But it is not so with me
My soul is weary of my life;
I will leave my complaint upon myself;
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul
Hast thou eyes of flesh
Or seest thou as man seeth
Are thy days as the days of man
Are thy years as man's days
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity,
And searchest after my sin
Thou knowest that I am not wicked;
And there is none that can deliver out of thine hand
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me
Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
And wilt thou bring me into dust again
Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
And curdled me like cheese
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
And hast fenced me with bones and sinews
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart:
I know that this is with thee
If I sin, then thou markest me,
And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb
Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me
I should have been as though I had not been;
I should have been carried from the womb to the grave
Before I go whence I shall not return,
Even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said
Should thy lies make men hold their peace
And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed
Canst thou by searching find out God
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection
The measure thereof is longer than the earth,
And broader than the sea
If he cut off, and shut up,
Or gather together, then who can hinder him
For vain man would be wise,
Though man be born like a wild ass's colt
If thou prepare thine heart,
And stretch out thine hands toward him
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away,
And let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;
Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear
Because thou shalt forget thy misery,
And remember it as waters that pass away
And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday;
Thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
Yea, many shall make suit unto thee
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,
And they shall not escape,
And their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost
No doubt but ye are the people,
And wisdom shall die with you
He that is ready to slip with his feet
Is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
And the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:
And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee
Who knoweth not in all these
That the hand of the LORD hath wrought this
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
And the breath of all mankind
Doth not the ear try words
And the mouth taste his meat
With the ancient is wisdom;
And in length of days understanding
With him is wisdom and strength,
He hath counsel and understanding
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again:
He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:
Also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,
And maketh the judges fools
He looseth the bond of kings,
And girdeth their loins with a girdle
He leadeth princes away spoiled,
And overthroweth the mighty
He removeth away the speech of the trusty,
And taketh away the understanding of the aged
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And weakeneth the strength of the mighty
He discovereth deep things out of darkness,
And bringeth out to light the shadow of death
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way
They grope in the dark without light,
And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man
What ye know, the same do I know also:
I am not inferior unto you
Surely I would speak to the Almighty,
And I desire to reason with God
But ye are forgers of lies,
Ye are all physicians of no value
O that ye would altogether hold your peace
And it should be your wisdom
Hear now my reasoning,
And hearken to the pleadings of my lips
Will ye accept his person
Will ye contend for God
Is it good that he should search you out
Or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him
He will surely reprove you,
If ye do secretly accept persons
Shall not his excellency make you afraid
And his dread fall upon you
Your remembrances are like unto ashes,
Your bodies to bodies of clay
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak,
And let come on me what will
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth,
And put my life in mine hand
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:
But I will maintain mine own ways before him
He also shall be my salvation:
For an hypocrite shall not come before him
Hear diligently my speech,
And my declaration with your ears
Behold now, I have ordered my cause;
I know that I shall be justified
Who is he that will plead with me
For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost
Withdraw thine hand far from me:
And let not thy dread make me afraid
Then call thou, and I will answer:
Or let me speak, and answer thou me
How many are mine iniquities and sins
Make me to know my transgression and my sin
Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
And holdest me for thine enemy
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro
And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble
For thou writest bitter things against me,
And makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth,
As a garment that is moth eaten
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:
He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one,
And bringest me into judgment with thee
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean
Not one
Turn from him, that he may rest,
Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,
And the stock thereof die in the ground
Yet through the scent of water it will bud,
And bring forth boughs like a plant
But man dieth, and wasteth away:
Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he
As the waters fail from the sea,
And the flood decayeth and drieth up
So man lieth down, and riseth not:
Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
Nor be raised out of their sleep
If a man die, shall he live again
All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
Till my change come
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee:
Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands
For now thou numberest my steps:
Dost thou not watch over my sin
My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
And thou sewest up mine iniquity
And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
And the rock is removed out of his place
The waters wear the stones:
Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;
And thou destroyest the hope of man
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth:
Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them
But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
And his soul within him shall mourn
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said
Should a wise man utter vain knowledge,
And fill his belly with the east wind
Should he reason with unprofitable talk
Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good
Yea, thou castest off fear,
And restrainest prayer before God
For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity,
And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I:
Yea, thine own lips testify against thee
Art thou the first man that was born
Or wast thou made before the hills
Hast thou heard the secret of God
And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself
What knowest thou, that we know not
What understandest thou, which is not in us
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men,
Much elder than thy father
Are the consolations of God small with thee
Is there any secret thing with thee
That thou turnest thy spirit against God,
And lettest such words go out of thy mouth
What is man, that he should be clean
And he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous
Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints;
Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight
How much more abominable and filthy is man,
Which drinketh iniquity like water
I will shew thee, hear me;
And that which I have seen I will declare
Which wise men have told
From their fathers, and have not hid it
Unto whom alone the earth was given,
And no stranger passed among them
The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,
And the number of years is hidden to the oppressor
A dreadful sound is in his ears:
In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him
He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,
And he is waited for of the sword
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it
He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand
Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid;
They shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle
For he stretcheth out his hand against God,
And strengtheneth himself against the Almighty
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
Neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:
For vanity shall be his recompence
He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,
And shall cast off his flower as the olive
For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate,
And fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity,
And their belly prepareth deceit
I have heard many such things:
Miserable comforters are ye all
Shall vain words have an end
Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest
I also could speak as ye do:
If your soul were in my soul's stead,
I could heap up words against you,
And shake mine head at you
But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
And the moving of my lips should asswage your grief
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged:
And though I forbear, what am I eased
But now he hath made me weary:
Thou hast made desolate all my company
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me:
And my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me:
He gnasheth upon me with his teeth;
Mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me
God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
And turned me over into the hands of the wicked
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder:
He hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces,
And set me up for his mark
His archers compass me round about,
He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
He poureth out my gall upon the ground
He breaketh me with breach upon breach,
He runneth upon me like a giant
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
And defiled my horn in the dust
My face is foul with weeping,
And on my eyelids is the shadow of death
Not for any injustice in mine hands:
Also my prayer is pure
O earth, cover not thou my blood,
And let my cry have no place
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
And my record is on high
My friends scorn me:
but mine eye poureth out tears unto God
O that one might plead for a man with God,
As a man pleadeth for his neighbour
When a few years are come,
Then I shall go the way whence I shall not return
Are there not mockers with me
And doth not mine eye continue in their provocation
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
Therefore shalt thou not exalt them
He that speaketh flattery to his friends,
Even the eyes of his children shall fail
He hath made me also a byword of the people;
And aforetime I was as a tabret
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
And all my members are as a shadow
Upright men shall be astonied at this,
And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite
The righteous also shall hold on his way,
And he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now:
For I cannot find one wise man among you
They change the night into day:
The light is short because of darkness
If I wait, the grave is mine house:
I have made my bed in the darkness
I have said to corruption, Thou art my father:
To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister
And where is now my hope
As for my hope, who shall see it
They shall go down to the bars of the pit,
When our rest together is in the dust
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said
How long will it be ere ye make an end of words
Mark, and afterwards we will speak
Wherefore are we counted as beasts,
And reputed vile in your sight
He teareth himself in his anger:
Shall the earth be forsaken for thee
And shall the rock be removed out of his place
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,
And the spark of his fire shall not shine
The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,
And his candle shall be put out with him
The steps of his strength shall be straitened,
And his own counsel shall cast him down
For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
And he walketh upon a snare
The snare is laid for him in the ground,
And a trap for him in the way
Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,
And shall drive him to his feet
It shall devour the strength of his skin:
Even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength
His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle,
And it shall bring him to the king of terrors
It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation
His roots shall be dried up beneath,
And above shall his branch be cut off
His remembrance shall perish from the earth,
And he shall have no name in the street
He shall be driven from light into darkness,
And chased out of the world
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people,
Nor any remaining in his dwellings
They that come after him shall be astonied at his day,
As they that went before were affrighted
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
And this is the place of him that knoweth not God
Then Job answered and said
How long will ye vex my soul,
And break me in pieces with words
These ten times have ye reproached me:
Ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me
And be it indeed that I have erred,
Mine error remaineth with myself
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
And plead against me my reproach
Know now that God hath overthrown me,
And hath compassed me with his net
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass,
And he hath set darkness in my paths
He hath stripped me of my glory,
And taken the crown from my head
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone:
And mine hope hath he removed like a tree
He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
And he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies
He hath put my brethren far from me,
And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer;
I intreated him with my mouth
My breath is strange to my wife,
Though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body
All my inward friends abhorred me:
And they whom I loved are turned against me
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
For the hand of God hath touched me
Why do ye persecute me as God,
And are not satisfied with my flesh
Oh that my words were now written
Oh that they were printed in a book
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead
In the rock for ever
For I know that my redeemer liveth,
And that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
And though after my skin worms destroy this body,
Yet in my flesh shall I see God
Whom I shall see for myself,
And mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
Though my reins be consumed within me
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer,
And for this I make haste
I have heard the check of my reproach,
And the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer
Knowest thou not this of old,
Since man was placed upon earth
That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
And the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens,
And his head reach unto the clouds
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night
The eye also which saw him shall see him no more;
Neither shall his place any more behold him
His children shall seek to please the poor,
And his hands shall restore their goods
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
Though he hide it under his tongue
Though he spare it, and forsake it not;
But keep it still within his mouth
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned,
It is the gall of asps within him
He shall suck the poison of asps:
The viper's tongue shall slay him
He shall not see the rivers,
The floods, the brooks of honey and butter
Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor;
Because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly,
He shall not save of that which he desired
There shall none of his meat be left;
Therefore shall no man look for his goods
When he is about to fill his belly,
God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him,
And shall rain it upon him while he is eating
He shall flee from the iron weapon,
And the bow of steel shall strike him through
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body;
Yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall:
Terrors are upon him
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places:
A fire not blown shall consume him;
It shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity;
And the earth shall rise up against him
The increase of his house shall depart,
And his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath
This is the portion of a wicked man from God,
And the heritage appointed unto him by God
Hear diligently my speech,
And let this be your consolations
Suffer me that I may speak;
And after that I have spoken, mock on
As for me, is my complaint to man
And if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled
Mark me, and be astonished,
And lay your hand upon your mouth
Even when I remember I am afraid,
And trembling taketh hold on my flesh
Wherefore do the wicked live,
Become old, yea, are mighty in power
Their seed is established in their sight with them,
And their offspring before their eyes
Their houses are safe from fear,
Neither is the rod of God upon them
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf
They send forth their little ones like a flock,
And their children dance
They take the timbrel and harp,
And rejoice at the sound of the organ
They spend their days in wealth,
And in a moment go down to the grave
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us;
For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways
Lo, their good is not in their hand:
The counsel of the wicked is far from me
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out
And how oft cometh their destruction upon them
God distributeth sorrows in his anger
They are as stubble before the wind,
And as chaff that the storm carrieth away
His eyes shall see his destruction,
And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him,
When the number of his months is cut off in the midst
Shall any teach God knowledge
Seeing he judgeth those that are high
One dieth in his full strength,
Being wholly at ease and quiet
His breasts are full of milk,
And his bones are moistened with marrow
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul,
And never eateth with pleasure
They shall lie down alike in the dust,
And the worms shall cover them
Behold, I know your thoughts,
And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me
Have ye not asked them that go by the way
And do ye not know their tokens
Who shall declare his way to his face
And who shall repay him what he hath done
Yet shall he be brought to the grave,
And shall remain in the tomb
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
And every man shall draw after him,
As there are innumerable before him
How then comfort ye me in vain,
Seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said
Can a man be profitable unto God,
As he that is wise may be profitable unto himself
Will he reprove thee for fear of thee
Will he enter with thee into judgment
Is not thy wickedness great
And thine iniquities infinite
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
And the honourable man dwelt in it
Thou hast sent widows away empty,
And the arms of the fatherless have been broken
Therefore snares are round about thee,
And sudden fear troubleth thee
Or darkness, that thou canst not see;
And abundance of waters cover thee
And thou sayest, How doth God know
Can he judge through the dark cloud
Hast thou marked the old way
Which wicked men have trodden
Which were cut down out of time,
Whose foundation was overflown with a flood
Yet he filled their houses with good things:
But the counsel of the wicked is far from me
The righteous see it, and are glad:
And the innocent laugh them to scorn
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
And lay up his words in thine heart
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust,
And the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence,
And thou shalt have plenty of silver
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
And thou shalt pay thy vows
Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee:
And the light shall shine upon thy ways
He shall deliver the island of the innocent:
And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands
Even to day is my complaint bitter:
My stroke is heavier than my groaning
Oh that I knew where I might find him
That I might come even to his seat
I would order my cause before him,
And fill my mouth with arguments
I would know the words which he would answer me,
And understand what he would say unto me
There the righteous might dispute with him;
So should I be delivered for ever from my judge
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there;
And backward, but I cannot perceive him
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him
But he knoweth the way that I take:
When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold
My foot hath held his steps,
His way have I kept, and not declined
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me:
And many such things are with him
Therefore am I troubled at his presence:
When I consider, I am afraid of him
For God maketh my heart soft,
And the Almighty troubleth me
Some remove the landmarks;
They violently take away flocks, and feed thereof
They drive away the ass of the fatherless,
They take the widow's ox for a pledge
They turn the needy out of the way:
The poor of the earth hide themselves together
They reap every one his corn in the field:
And they gather the vintage of the wicked
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing,
That they have no covering in the cold
They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
And embrace the rock for want of a shelter
They pluck the fatherless from the breast,
And take a pledge of the poor
They cause him to go naked without clothing,
And they take away the sheaf from the hungry
Which make oil within their walls,
And tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst
Men groan from out of the city,
And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
Yet God layeth not folly to them
They are of those that rebel against the light;
They know not the ways thereof,
Nor abide in the paths thereof
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
Saying, No eye shall see me:
And disguiseth his face
In the dark they dig through houses,
Which they had marked for themselves in the daytime:
They know not the light
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death:
If one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
He is swift as the waters;
Their portion is cursed in the earth:
He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards
Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
So doth the grave those which have sinned
He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not:
And doeth not good to the widow
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
Yet his eyes are upon their ways
Dominion and fear are with him,
He maketh peace in his high places
Is there any number of his armies
And upon whom doth not his light arise
How much less man, that is a worm
And the son of man, which is a worm
How hast thou helped him that is without power
How savest thou the arm that hath no strength
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom
And how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is
To whom hast thou uttered words
And whose spirit came from thee
Dead things are formed
From under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,
And hangeth the earth upon nothing
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;
And the cloud is not rent under them
He holdeth back the face of his throne,
And spreadeth his cloud upon it
The pillars of heaven tremble
And are astonished at his reproof
He divideth the sea with his power,
And by his understanding he smiteth through the proud
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens;
His hand hath formed the crooked serpent
Lo, these are parts of his ways:
But how little a portion is heard of him
But the thunder of his power who can understand
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said
My lips shall not speak wickedness,
Nor my tongue utter deceit
God forbid that I should justify you:
Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me
Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
When God taketh away his soul
Will he delight himself in the Almighty
Will he always call upon God
I will teach you by the hand of God:
That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
Why then are ye thus altogether vain
This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
And the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword:
And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death:
And his widows shall not weep
Though he heap up silver as the dust,
And prepare raiment as the clay
He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
And the innocent shall divide the silver
He buildeth his house as a moth,
And as a booth that the keeper maketh
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered:
He openeth his eyes, and he is not
Terrors take hold on him as waters,
A tempest stealeth him away in the night
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth:
And as a storm hurleth him out of his place
For God shall cast upon him, and not spare:
He would fain flee out of his hand
Men shall clap their hands at him,
And shall hiss him out of his place
Surely there is a vein for the silver,
And a place for gold where they fine it
Iron is taken out of the earth,
And brass is molten out of the stone
He setteth an end to darkness,
And searcheth out all perfection:
The stones of darkness, and the shadow of death
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;
Even the waters forgotten of the foot:
They are dried up, they are gone away from men
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread:
And under it is turned up as it were fire
There is a path which no fowl knoweth,
And which the vulture's eye hath not seen
The lion's whelps have not trodden it,
Nor the fierce lion passed by it
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock;
He overturneth the mountains by the roots
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks;
And his eye seeth every precious thing
He bindeth the floods from overflowing;
And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light
But where shall wisdom be found
And where is the place of understanding
It cannot be gotten for gold,
Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
With the precious onyx, or the sapphire
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it:
And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
Neither shall it be valued with pure gold
Whence then cometh wisdom
And where is the place of understanding
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
And kept close from the fowls of the air
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
And seeth under the whole heaven
To make the weight for the winds;
And he weigheth the waters by measure
When he made a decree for the rain,
And a way for the lightning of the thunder
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said
Oh that I were as in months past,
As in the days when God preserved me
When the Almighty was yet with me,
When my children were about me
When I went out to the gate through the city,
When I prepared my seat in the street
The young men saw me, and hid themselves:
And the aged arose, and stood up
The princes refrained talking,
And laid their hand on their mouth
The nobles held their peace,
And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth
When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me:
And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
My judgment was as a robe and a diadem
I was eyes to the blind,
And feet was I to the lame
I was a father to the poor:
And the cause which I knew not I searched out
And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
And plucked the spoil out of his teeth
My root was spread out by the waters,
And the dew lay all night upon my branch
My glory was fresh in me,
And my bow was renewed in my hand
Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
And kept silence at my counsel
After my words they spake not again;
And my speech dropped upon them
And they waited for me as for the rain;
And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain
If I laughed on them, they believed it not;
And the light of my countenance they cast not down
I chose out their way, and sat chief,
And dwelt as a king in the army,
As one that comforteth the mourners
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me,
In whom old age was perished
They were driven forth from among men,
(They cried after them as after a thief;)
To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
in caves of the earth, and in the rocks
Among the bushes they brayed;
Under the nettles they were gathered together
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men:
They were viler than the earth
And now am I their song,
Yea, I am their byword
They abhor me, they flee far from me,
And spare not to spit in my face
Upon my right hand rise the youth;
They push away my feet,
And they raise up against me the ways of their destruction
They mar my path,
They set forward my calamity,
They have no helper
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters:
In the desolation they rolled themselves upon me
And now my soul is poured out upon me;
The days of affliction have taken hold upon me
My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
And my sinews take no rest
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed:
It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat
He hath cast me into the mire,
And I am become like dust and ashes
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me:
I stand up, and thou regardest me not
Thou art become cruel to me:
With thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,
And to the house appointed for all living
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,
Though they cry in his destruction
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble
Was not my soul grieved for the poor
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me:
And when I waited for light, there came darkness
My bowels boiled, and rested not:
The days of affliction prevented me
My skin is black upon me,
And my bones are burned with heat
My harp also is turned to mourning,
And my organ into the voice of them that weep
I made a covenant with mine eyes;
Why then should I think upon a maid
Is not destruction to the wicked
And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity
Doth not he see my ways,
And count all my steps
If I have walked with vanity,
Or if my foot hath hasted to deceit
Let me be weighed in an even balance,
That God may know mine integrity
If my step hath turned out of the way,
And mine heart walked after mine eyes,
And if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands
Then let me sow, and let another eat;
Yea, let my offspring be rooted out
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman,
Or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door
Then let my wife grind unto another,
And let others bow down upon her
For this is an heinous crime;
Yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction,
And would root out all mine increase
If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father,
And I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
Or any poor without covering
If his loins have not blessed me,
And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
When I saw my help in the gate
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade,
And mine arm be broken from the bone
For destruction from God was a terror to me,
And by reason of his highness I could not endure
If I have made gold my hope,
Or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
And because mine hand had gotten much
If I beheld the sun when it shined,
Or the moon walking in brightness
And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
Or my mouth hath kissed my hand
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge:
For I should have denied the God that is above
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
Or lifted up myself when evil found him
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin
By wishing a curse to his soul
If the men of my tabernacle said not,
Oh that we had of his flesh
The stranger did not lodge in the street:
But I opened my doors to the traveller
If I covered my transgressions as Adam,
By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom
Did I fear a great multitude,
Or did the contempt of families terrify me,
That I kept silence, and went not out of the door
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
And bind it as a crown to me
I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
As a prince would I go near unto him
If my land cry against me,
Or that the furrows likewise thereof complain
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life
Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
And cockle instead of barley
The words of Job are ended
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job
Great men are not always wise:
Neither do the aged understand judgment
Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
I also will shew mine opinion
Behold, I waited for your words;
I gave ear to your reasons,
Whilst ye searched out what to say
Now he hath not directed his words against me:
Neither will I answer him with your speeches
They were amazed, they answered no more:
They left off speaking
When I had waited, (for they spake not,
But stood still, and answered no more;)
I said, I will answer also my part,
I also will shew mine opinion
For I am full of matter,
The spirit within me constraineth me
Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent;
It is ready to burst like new bottles
I will speak, that I may be refreshed:
I will open my lips and answer
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person,
Neither let me give flattering titles unto man
Behold, now I have opened my mouth,
My tongue hath spoken in my mouth
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart:
And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly
The Spirit of God hath made me,
And the breath of the Almighty hath given me life
If thou canst answer me,
Set thy words in order before me, stand up
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead:
I also am formed out of the clay
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
Neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing,
And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying
I am clean without transgression,
I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me
Behold, he findeth occasions against me,
He counteth me for his enemy
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee,
that God is greater than man
Why dost thou strive against him
For he giveth not account of any of his matters
For God speaketh once,
Yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not
In a dream, in a vision of the night,
When deep sleep falleth upon men,
In slumberings upon the bed
Then he openeth the ears of men,
And sealeth their instruction
That he may withdraw man from his purpose,
And hide pride from man
He keepeth back his soul from the pit,
And his life from perishing by the sword
So that his life abhorreth bread,
And his soul dainty meat
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
And his bones that were not seen stick out
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave,
And his life to the destroyers
If there be a messenger with him,
An interpreter, one among a thousand,
To shew unto man his uprightness
His flesh shall be fresher than a child's:
He shall return to the days of his youth
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
And he shall see his face with joy:
For he will render unto man his righteousness
He looketh upon men, and if any say,
I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,
And it profited me not
Lo, all these things worketh God
Oftentimes with man
To bring back his soul from the pit,
To be enlightened with the light of the living
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:
Hold thy peace, and I will speak
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me:
Speak, for I desire to justify thee
For the ear trieth words,
As the mouth tasteth meat
Let us choose to us judgment:
Let us know among ourselves what is good
For Job hath said, I am righteous:
And God hath taken away my judgment
What man is like Job,
Who drinketh up scorning like water
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
And walketh with wicked men
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness;
And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity
For the work of a man shall he render unto him,
And cause every man to find according to his ways
Who hath given him a charge over the earth
Or who hath disposed the whole world
If he set his heart upon man,
If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath
All flesh shall perish together,
And man shall turn again unto dust
If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
Hearken to the voice of my words
Shall even he that hateth right govern
And wilt thou condemn him that is most just
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes,
Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor
For they all are the work of his hands
In a moment shall they die,
And the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away:
And the mighty shall be taken away without hand
For his eyes are upon the ways of man,
And he seeth all his goings
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves
For he will not lay upon man more than right;
That he should enter into judgment with God
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number,
And set others in their stead
Therefore he knoweth their works,
And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed
He striketh them as wicked men
In the open sight of others
Because they turned back from him,
And would not consider any of his ways
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him,
And he heareth the cry of the afflicted
That the hypocrite reign not,
Lest the people be ensnared
Surely it is meet to be said unto God,
I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more
Should it be according to thy mind
He will recompense it, whether thou refuse,
Or whether thou choose; and not I:
Therefore speak what thou knowest
Let men of understanding tell me,
And let a wise man hearken unto me
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end
Because of his answers for wicked men
Elihu also proceeded, and said
I will answer thee,
And thy companions with thee
Look unto the heavens, and see;
And behold the clouds which are higher than thou
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him
Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him
Or what receiveth he of thine hand
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;
And thy righteousness may profit the son of man
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry:
They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty
There they cry, but none giveth answer,
Because of the pride of evil men
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
Yet he knoweth it not in great extremity
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain;
He multiplieth words without knowledge
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee
That I have yet to speak on God's behalf
I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker
For truly my words shall not be false:
He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:
He is mighty in strength and wisdom
He preserveth not the life of the wicked:
But giveth right to the poor
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
But with kings are they on the throne;
Yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted
And if they be bound in fetters,
And be holden in cords of affliction
Then he sheweth them their work,
And their transgressions that they have exceeded
He openeth also their ear to discipline,
And commandeth that they return from iniquity
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait
Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
And that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness
Desire not the night,
When people are cut off in their place
Take heed, regard not iniquity:
For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction
Behold, God exalteth by his power:
Who teacheth like him
Remember that thou magnify his work,
Which men behold
Every man may see it;
Man may behold it afar off
Behold, God is great, and we know him not,
Neither can the number of his years be searched out
For he maketh small the drops of water:
They pour down rain according to the vapour thereof
Which the clouds do drop
And distil upon man abundantly
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
Or the noise of his tabernacle
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it,
And covereth the bottom of the sea
With clouds he covereth the light;
And commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt
At this also my heart trembleth,
And is moved out of his place
Hear attentively the noise of his voice,
And the sound that goeth out of his mouth
He directeth it under the whole heaven,
And his lightning unto the ends of the earth
God thundereth marvellously with his voice;
Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend
He sealeth up the hand of every man;
That all men may know his work
Then the beasts go into dens,
And remain in their places
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind:
And cold out of the north
By the breath of God frost is given:
And the breadth of the waters is straitened
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud:
He scattereth his bright cloud
And it is turned round about by his counsels:
That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
Upon the face of the world in the earth
Dost thou know when God disposed them,
And caused the light of his cloud to shine
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
The wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge
Hast thou with him spread out the sky,
Which is strong, and as a molten looking glass
Teach us what we shall say unto him;
For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness
Shall it be told him that I speak
If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up
Fair weather cometh out of the north:
With God is terrible majesty
Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
He is excellent in power, and in judgment,
And in plenty of justice: he will not afflict
Men do therefore fear him:
He respecteth not any that are wise of heart
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said
Who is this that darkeneth counsel
By words without knowledge
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth
Declare, if thou hast understanding
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened
Or who laid the corner stone thereof
When the morning stars sang together,
And all the sons of God shouted for joy
Or who shut up the sea with doors,
When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb
When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it
And brake up for it my decreed place,
And set bars and doors
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;
And caused the dayspring to know his place
It is turned as clay to the seal;
And they stand as a garment
And from the wicked their light is withholden,
And the high arm shall be broken
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea
Or hast thou walked in the search of the depth
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee
Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth
Declare if thou knowest it all
Where is the way where light dwelleth
And as for darkness, where is the place thereof
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow
Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
Against the day of battle and war
By what way is the light parted,
Which scattereth the east wind upon the earth
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
Or a way for the lightning of thunder
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is;
On the wilderness, wherein there is no man
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;
And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth
Hath the rain a father
Or who hath begotten the drops of dew
The waters are hid as with a stone,
And the face of the deep is frozen
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season
Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven
Canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
That abundance of waters may cover thee
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts
Or who hath given understanding to the heart
Who can number the clouds in wisdom
Or who can stay the bottles of heaven
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion
Or fill the appetite of the young lions
When they couch in their dens,
And abide in the covert to lie in wait
Who provideth for the raven his food
When his young ones cry unto God,
They wander for lack of meat
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth
Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil
Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,
They cast out their sorrows
Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
They go forth, and return not unto them
Who hath sent out the wild ass free
Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass
Whose house I have made the wilderness,
And the barren land his dwellings
Neither regardeth he the crying of the driver
The range of the mountains is his pasture,
And he searcheth after every green thing
Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee,
Or abide by thy crib
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow
Or will he harrow the valleys after thee
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great
Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed,
And gather it into thy barn
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks
Or wings and feathers unto the ostrich
Which leaveth her eggs in the earth,
And warmeth them in dust
And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
Or that the wild beast may break them
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's:
Her labour is in vain without fear
What time she lifteth up herself on high,
She scorneth the horse and his rider
Hast thou given the horse strength
Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder
Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper
The glory of his nostrils is terrible
He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
He goeth on to meet the armed men
He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
Neither turneth he back from the sword
The quiver rattleth against him,
The glittering spear and the shield
He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage:
Neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha;
And he smelleth the battle afar off,
The thunder of the captains, and the shouting
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,
And stretch her wings toward the south
Doth the eagle mount up at thy command,
And make her nest on high
She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
Upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place
From thence she seeketh the prey,
And her eyes behold afar off
Her young ones also suck up blood:
And where the slain are, there is she
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him
He that reproveth God, let him answer it
Then Job answered the LORD, and said
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee
I will lay mine hand upon my mouth
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer:
Yea, twice; but I will proceed no further
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment
Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous
Hast thou an arm like God
Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency;
And array thyself with glory and beauty
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath:
And behold every one that is proud, and abase him
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
And tread down the wicked in their place
Hide them in the dust together;
And bind their faces in secret
Then will I also confess unto thee
That thine own right hand can save thee
Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
And his force is in the navel of his belly
He moveth his tail like a cedar:
The sinews of his stones are wrapped together
His bones are as strong pieces of brass;
His bones are like bars of iron
He is the chief of the ways of God:
He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him
Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
Where all the beasts of the field play
He lieth under the shady trees,
In the covert of the reed, and fens
The shady trees cover him with their shadow;
The willows of the brook compass him about
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not:
He trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth
He taketh it with his eyes:
His nose pierceth through snares
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook
Or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down
Canst thou put an hook into his nose
Or bore his jaw through with a thorn
Will he make many supplications unto thee
Will he speak soft words unto thee
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird
Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens
Shall the companions make a banquet of him
Shall they part him among the merchants
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons
Or his head with fish spears
Lay thine hand upon him,
Remember the battle, do no more
Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him
None is so fierce that dare stir him up:
Who then is able to stand before me
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him
Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
I will not conceal his parts,
Nor his power, nor his comely proportion
Who can open the doors of his face
His teeth are terrible round about
One is so near to another,
That no air can come between them
They are joined one to another,
They stick together, that they cannot be sundered
By his neesings a light doth shine,
And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning
Out of his mouth go burning lamps,
And sparks of fire leap out
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
As out of a seething pot or caldron
His breath kindleth coals,
And a flame goeth out of his mouth
His heart is as firm as a stone;
Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:
By reason of breakings they purify themselves
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:
The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon
He esteemeth iron as straw,
And brass as rotten wood
Darts are counted as stubble:
He laugheth at the shaking of a spear
He maketh a path to shine after him;
One would think the deep to be hoary
Upon earth there is not his like,
Who is made without fear
He beholdeth all high things:
He is a king over all the children of pride
I know that thou canst do every thing,
And that no thought can be withholden from thee
I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:
But now mine eye seeth thee
Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent
In dust and ashes
And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before
He had also seven sons and three daughters
And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations
So Job died, being old and full of days
Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses
From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast
Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land
And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go
And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were
And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof
and she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed
And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath
Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall
And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear
Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee
And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him
So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them
And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over
And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host
and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it
And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people
And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee
And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan
Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man
And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people
And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying
Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man
Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man
And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people
And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them
On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life
And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho
And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal
Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land
And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel
And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins
And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt
Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised
And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole
And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho
And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day
And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year
And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy
And Joshua did so
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in
And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour
So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD
And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times
And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent
And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword
And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD
So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country
And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country
And the men went up and viewed Ai
So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai
So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken
and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it
And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD
And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai
And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai
And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua
For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai
Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua
And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel
And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law
There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them
And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof
that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord
And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai
they did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up
and old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy
and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth
This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy
And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD
And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them
And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel
And all the congregation murmured against the princes
But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them
And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us
And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not
Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them
that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty
Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour
Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night
And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal
But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah
And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah
And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them
And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon
And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening
Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah
And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining
And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it
and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish
And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it
And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon
And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal
And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph
and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west
and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh
And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many
And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel
So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them
And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire
And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms
But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn
And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe
As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses
even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them
Joshua made war a long time with all those kings
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained
Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon
and from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah
and the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei
and reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions
in the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites
Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed
This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri
from Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites
from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites
and the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath
with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them
from Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon
and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah
Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day
Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them
And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families
And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba
Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon
and Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley
and Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth
Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them
And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families
And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah
and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir
and in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages
And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families
And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities
These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them
By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe
For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them
As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land
Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea
And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old
As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in
And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel
And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims
And the land had rest from war
And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward
and it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa
And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan
and the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel
and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah
and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea
And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families
and Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor
and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet
and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Bizjothjah
and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages
and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam
and Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages
Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad
and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages
and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages
Ekron, with her towns and her villages
from Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages
Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof
and Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which is Debir
and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages
and Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah
and Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages
Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages
Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor
and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages
Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages
and Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day
But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah
And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan
And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you
Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God
And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions
And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven
And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah
and the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel
and was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben
and passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah
and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el
and Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages
and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families
The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses
that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood
And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime
And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah
And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh
All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs
These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities
There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass
Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God
And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan
So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to
And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel
And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them
And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest
and with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel
And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying
Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD
but that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD
and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel
Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel
that we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it
And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God
And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age
And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age
and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you
Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left
but cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day
One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you
Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God
Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you
Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you
And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods
I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea
Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you
but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand
And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand
And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods
for the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem
So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance
And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash
And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel
And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim
And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock
If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him
And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them
If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD
And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary
And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung
even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt
And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty
when the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation
And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD
And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail
And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation

Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty
Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty
Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these

and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin
And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering
and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering
And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him
And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity
It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD
If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour
or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein

And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place
The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out
And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar
And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD
And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it
This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night

And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering

And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning
But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat
And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it
For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people
Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings

And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'
And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings
He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel
This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office
which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations
This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai
And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel
and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD
also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you
And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you
And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded
Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar
but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp
And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar
And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar
And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner
And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning
and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar
and the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded
And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings
And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD
So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said
And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you
And they did according to the word of Moses
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying
and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean
and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses
And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying
Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded
And when Moses heard that, he was content
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat
And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you
And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you
Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you
These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat
And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you
they shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination
Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you
And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray
and the vulture, and the kite after his kind
every raven after his kind
and the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind
and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl
and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle
and the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat
All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you
Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth
even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind
But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you
And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even
And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even
The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean
And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even
These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind
and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole
And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it
Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean
Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean
And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean
But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you
And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even
And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even
And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten
Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination
For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy
This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth
to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean
And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised
But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days
And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying
When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests
If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days
But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again
and if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy
When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest
And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh
then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean
But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean
Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest
and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean
The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed
and in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest
and if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil
But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean
Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white
But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy
And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning
If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard
And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin
he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more
But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing
If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots
And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean
And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean
And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead
All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be
The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment
whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin
and if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest
and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days
He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire
And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more
And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof
and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire
And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean
This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water
as for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water
But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean
And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD

and the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering
And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil
and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering
And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD

and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD
And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get
This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing
When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession
and he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house
then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house
and he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city
and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place
and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house
And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered
then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean
And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place
Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even
And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes
And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed
And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop
and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water
and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times
and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet
This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall
and for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house
and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean

And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean
And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean
And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even
But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean
And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them
This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith
and of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean
And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died
and the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat
Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering
And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering
And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house
And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat
And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering
But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness
And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself
and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail
and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times
Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat
And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel
And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel
And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness
And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there
and he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people
And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar
And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp
And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung
And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp
And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you

And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year
And he did as the LORD commanded Moses
For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God

Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness
Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination
Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you
and the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants
(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)
that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you
For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people

And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering

But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal
Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard
And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure
And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name
And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not
then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people
Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death
And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast
And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people
but for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother
and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled
They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh
They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God
And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire
For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous
or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded
or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken
He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy
And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest
and he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD
Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation
Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God
For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD
On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein
And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD
Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant
and they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin
And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones
And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses
And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof
And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land
A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed
For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field
In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession
And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another
according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety
then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years
And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store
The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land
If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold
And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it
then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession
But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time
And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel
And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee
Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God
And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen
Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family
And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption
And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him
If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them
then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword
For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you
And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you
And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright
But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments
and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant
And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you
And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins
And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass
and your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate
And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me
then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me
then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me
and that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary
And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels
And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels
And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver
And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels
And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy
But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation
And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him
And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more
And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession
then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD
In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong
Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's
None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death
And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD
And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof
And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD
These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai
We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses
Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand
Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request
So I prayed to the God of heaven
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah
and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into
And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me
When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel
So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days
Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me
And they said, Let us rise up and build
So they strengthened their hands for this good work
And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord
And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem
Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces
And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters
After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty
After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah
And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall
After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest
After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib
And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain
After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner
Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out
After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel
From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house
After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner
And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews
will they fortify themselves
will they sacrifice
will they make an end in a day
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned
So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth
and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it
Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them
Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows
And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work
And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared
So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother
And I set a great assembly against them
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied
And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD
And the people did according to this promise

And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them
This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying
Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover
And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD
The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents
And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed
Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps
And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee
When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward
When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys
But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm
And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony
And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran
And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward
And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp
And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched
And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them
And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat
We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick
And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium
And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil
And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it
And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant
and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me
Have I conceived all this people
have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers
Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people
for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat
I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me
Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days
And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month
And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel
And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth
And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague
And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted
And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth
And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman
And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses
hath he not spoken also by us
And the LORD heard it
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed
And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned
And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh
Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi
Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi
Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli
Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain
and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many
So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath
And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs
The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence
And they returned from searching of the land after forty days
And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel
And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes
and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land
Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying
Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying
And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word
but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD
Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice
How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me
Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you
your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me
doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun
But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised
But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness
And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise
And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD
But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still
And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly
And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD
but it shall not prosper
Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies
But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you
then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD
Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it
And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses
even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations
then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance
And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them
But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation
And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him
And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses
Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue
and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men
And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face
This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company
And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them
And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also
And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow
And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron
And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him
And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind
If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me
And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them
and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods
And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense
Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed
And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar
to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses
And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared
And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation
Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment
And they fell upon their faces
And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed
Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah
And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed
Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod
And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods
And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds
And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he
And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish
And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die
And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel
And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons
In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee
All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee
Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine
Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine
And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die
Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe
And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress
Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress
And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation
And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron
And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD
And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there
And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him
This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them
how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers
Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him
And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel
And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died
And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising
From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared
and from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
and from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon
And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying
And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong
And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,
Come into Heshbon,
Let the city of Sihon be built and prepared
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon,
A flame from the city of Sihon:
It hath consumed Ar of Moab,
And the lords of the high places of Arnon
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites
And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there
So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land
And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho
And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites
And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel
And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field
And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time
And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying
And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they
And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more
And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab
But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side
And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again
And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left
And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times
behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me
And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak
And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast
And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee
wherefore camest thou not unto me
And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth
And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people
God is not a man, that he should lie;
Neither the son of man, that he should repent:
Hath he said, and shall he not do it
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good
God brought them out of Egypt;
He hath as it were the strength of an unicorn
He hath said, which heard the words of God,
Which saw the vision of the Almighty,
Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open
How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,
And thy tabernacles, O Israel
As the valleys are they spread forth,
As gardens by the river's side,
As the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted,
And as cedar trees beside the waters
He shall pour the water out of his buckets,
And his seed shall be in many waters,
And his king shall be higher than Agag,
And his kingdom shall be exalted
And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times
And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying
If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak
And he took up his parable, and said,
Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
And the man whose eyes are open hath said
He hath said, which heard the words of God,
And knew the knowledge of the Most High,
Which saw the vision of the Almighty,
Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open
I shall see him, but not now:
I shall behold him, but not nigh:
There shall come a Star out of Jacob,
And a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,
And shall smite the corners of Moab,
And destroy all the children of Sheth
And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
Strong is thy dwellingplace,
And thou puttest thy nest in a rock
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods
And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand
And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy
Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace
And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying
And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying
And the sons of Pallu; Eliab
And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram
This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD
Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not
The sons of Judah were Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan
The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and Ephraim
And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah
Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names
Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit
And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar
And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD
These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai
And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying
Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons
And Moses brought their cause before the LORD
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter
And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren
And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren
And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel
And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered
And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying
Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation
And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation
And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering
The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even
and a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil
It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD
And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof
this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering
And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering
And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD
And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten
In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish
a several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you
Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering
And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year
a several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you
And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish
and one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish
a several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs
and ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish
and a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and their drink offerings
And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering
And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish
and their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering
On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work therein
but ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner
and one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering
And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying
even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle
And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them
Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land
For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them
And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying
Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me
And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed
And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel
And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones
We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance
And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war
and will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him
But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead
So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel
and Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do
And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about
And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer
and Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah
And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim
And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it
And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein
And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair
And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name
And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians
For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments
And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth
And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness
And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before Migdol
And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah
And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there
And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea
And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin
And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah
And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush
And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink
And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai
And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibroth-hattaavah
And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth
And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah
And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmon-parez
And they departed from Rimmon-parez, and pitched in Libnah
And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah
And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah
And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher
And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah
And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth
And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath
And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah
And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah
And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah
And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth
And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan
And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad
And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah
And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah
And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-geber
And they removed from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh
And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom
And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month
And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor
And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel
And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah
And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon
And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of Moab
And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad
And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim
And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo
And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan
and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it
Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon
and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea
And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border
And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor
from mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad
and the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border
And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham
and the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward
then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares
And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment
And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel
and they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters
And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well
This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry
So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers
Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad
for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons
and they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father
These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel
To receive the instruction of wisdom,
Justice, and judgment, and equity
To give subtilty to the simple,
To the young man knowledge and discretion
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning;
And a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;
The words of the wise, and their dark sayings
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge:
But fools despise wisdom and instruction
My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
And forsake not the law of thy mother
For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,
And chains about thy neck
My son, if sinners entice thee,
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave;
And whole, as those that go down into the pit
My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
Refrain thy foot from their path
For their feet run to evil,
And make haste to shed blood
Surely in vain the net is spread
In the sight of any bird
And they lay wait for their own blood;
They lurk privily for their own lives
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
Which taketh away the life of the owners thereof
Wisdom crieth without;
She uttereth her voice in the streets
She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates:
In the city she uttereth her words, saying
Turn you at my reproof:
Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
I will make known my words unto you
Because I have called, and ye refused;
I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded
But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
And would none of my reproof
I also will laugh at your calamity;
I will mock when your fear cometh
When your fear cometh as desolation,
And your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;
When distress and anguish cometh upon you
For that they hated knowledge,
And did not choose the fear of the LORD
They would none of my counsel:
They despised all my reproof
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
And be filled with their own devices
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,
And shall be quiet from fear of evil
My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
And hide my commandments with thee
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,
And apply thine heart to understanding
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
And liftest up thy voice for understanding
If thou seekest her as silver,
And searchest for her as for hid treasures
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
And find the knowledge of God
For the LORD giveth wisdom:
Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:
He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly
He keepeth the paths of judgment,
And preserveth the way of his saints
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment,
And equity; yea, every good path
When wisdom entereth into thine heart,
And knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul
Discretion shall preserve thee,
Understanding shall keep thee
To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
From the man that speaketh froward things
Who leave the paths of uprightness,
To walk in the ways of darkness
Who rejoice to do evil,
And delight in the frowardness of the wicked
Whose ways are crooked,
And they froward in their paths
To deliver thee from the strange woman,
Even from the stranger which flattereth with her words
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth,
And forgetteth the covenant of her God
For her house inclineth unto death,
And her paths unto the dead
None that go unto her return again,
Neither take they hold of the paths of life
That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
And keep the paths of the righteous
For the upright shall dwell in the land,
And the perfect shall remain in it
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth,
And the transgressors shall be rooted out of it
My son, forget not my law;
But let thine heart keep my commandments
For length of days, and long life,
And peace, shall they add to thee
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding
In the sight of God and man
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart;
And lean not unto thine own understanding
In all thy ways acknowledge him,
And he shall direct thy paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes:
Fear the LORD, and depart from evil
It shall be health to thy navel,
And marrow to thy bones
Honour the LORD with thy substance,
And with the firstfruits of all thine increase
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
And thy presses shall burst out with new wine
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;
Neither be weary of his correction
For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;
Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth
Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
And the man that getteth understanding
For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
And the gain thereof than fine gold
She is more precious than rubies:
And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her
Length of days is in her right hand;
And in her left hand riches and honour
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace
The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth;
By understanding hath he established the heavens
By his knowledge the depths are broken up,
And the clouds drop down the dew
So shall they be life unto thy soul,
And grace to thy neck
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely,
And thy foot shall not stumble
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet
Be not afraid of sudden fear,
Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh
For the LORD shall be thy confidence,
And shall keep thy foot from being taken
Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee
Strive not with a man without cause,
If he have done thee no harm
Envy thou not the oppressor,
And choose none of his ways
For the froward is abomination to the LORD:
But his secret is with the righteous
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked:
But he blesseth the habitation of the just
Surely he scorneth the scorners:
But he giveth grace unto the lowly
The wise shall inherit glory:
But shame shall be the promotion of fools
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
And attend to know understanding
For I give you good doctrine,
Forsake ye not my law
For I was my father's son,
Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother
He taught me also, and said unto me,
Let thine heart retain my words:
Keep my commandments, and live
Get wisdom, get understanding:
Forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:
Love her, and she shall keep thee
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom:
And with all thy getting get understanding
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee:
She shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her
She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace:
A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
And the years of thy life shall be many
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
And when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
Keep her; for she is thy life
Enter not into the path of the wicked,
And go not in the way of evil men
Avoid it, pass not by it,
Turn from it, and pass away
For they eat the bread of wickedness,
And drink the wine of violence
The way of the wicked is as darkness:
They know not at what they stumble
My son, attend to my words;
Incline thine ear unto my sayings
Let them not depart from thine eyes;
Keep them in the midst of thine heart
For they are life unto those that find them,
And health to all their flesh
Keep thy heart with all diligence;
For out of it are the issues of life
Put away from thee a froward mouth,
And perverse lips put far from thee
Let thine eyes look right on,
And let thine eyelids look straight before thee
Ponder the path of thy feet,
And let all thy ways be established
Remove thy foot from evil
My son, attend unto my wisdom,
And bow thine ear to my understanding
That thou mayest regard discretion,
And that thy lips may keep knowledge
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,
And her mouth is smoother than oil
But her end is bitter as wormwood,
Sharp as a twoedged sword
Her feet go down to death;
Her steps take hold on hell
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life,
Her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them
Hear me now therefore, O ye children,
And depart not from the words of my mouth
Remove thy way far from her,
And come not nigh the door of her house
Lest thou give thine honour unto others,
And thy years unto the cruel
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth;
And thy labours be in the house of a stranger
And thou mourn at the last,
When thy flesh and thy body are consumed
And say, How have I hated instruction,
And my heart despised reproof
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me
Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
And running waters out of thine own well
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad,
And rivers of waters in the streets
Let them be only thine own,
And not strangers' with thee
Let thy fountain be blessed:
And rejoice with the wife of thy youth
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe;
Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
And be thou ravished always with her love
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
And embrace the bosom of a stranger
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD,
And he pondereth all his goings
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself,
And he shall be holden with the cords of his sins
He shall die without instruction;
And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend,
If thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
When thou art come into the hand of thy friend;
Go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend
Give not sleep to thine eyes,
Nor slumber to thine eyelids
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter,
And as a bird from the hand of the fowler
Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
Consider her ways, and be wise
Which having no guide,
Overseer, or ruler
Provideth her meat in the summer,
And gathereth her food in the harvest
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard
When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to sleep
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth,
And thy want as an armed man
A naughty person, a wicked man,
Walketh with a froward mouth
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
He soweth discord
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
Suddenly shall he be broken without remedy
These six things doth the LORD hate:
Yea, seven are an abomination unto him
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
Feet that be swift in running to mischief
A false witness that speaketh lies,
And he that soweth discord among brethren
My son, keep thy father's commandment,
And forsake not the law of thy mother
Bind them continually upon thine heart,
And tie them about thy neck
When thou goest, it shall lead thee;
When thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;
And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee
To keep thee from the evil woman,
From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart;
Neither let her take thee with her eyelids
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread:
And the adulteress will hunt for the precious life
Can a man take fire in his bosom,
And his clothes not be burned
Can one go upon hot coals,
And his feet not be burned
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife;
Whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
To satisfy his soul when he is hungry
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
He shall give all the substance of his house
But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding:
He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul
A wound and dishonour shall he get;
And his reproach shall not be wiped away
For jealousy is the rage of a man:
Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance
He will not regard any ransom;
Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts
Keep my commandments, and live;
And my law as the apple of thine eye
Bind them upon thy fingers,
Write them upon the table of thine heart
That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
From the stranger which flattereth with her words
For at the window of my house
I looked through my casement
Passing through the street near her corner;
And he went the way to her house
In the twilight, in the evening,
In the black and dark night
And, behold, there met him a woman
With the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart
(She is loud and stubborn;
Her feet abide not in her house
So she caught him, and kissed him,
And with an impudent face said unto him
I have peace offerings with me;
This day have I payed my vows
Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,
With carved works, with fine linen of Egypt
I have perfumed my bed
With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning:
Let us solace ourselves with loves
For the goodman is not at home,
He is gone a long journey
He hath taken a bag of money with him,
And will come home at the day appointed
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,
With the flattering of her lips she forced him
Till a dart strike through his liver;
As a bird hasteth to the snare,
And knoweth not that it is for his life
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children,
And attend to the words of my mouth
Let not thine heart decline to her ways,
Go not astray in her paths
For she hath cast down many wounded:
Yea, many strong men have been slain by her
Her house is the way to hell,
Going down to the chambers of death
Doth not wisdom cry
And understanding put forth her voice
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way
In the places of the paths
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,
At the coming in at the doors
Unto you, O men, I call;
And my voice is to the sons of man
O ye simple, understand wisdom:
And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart
Hear; for I will speak of excellent things;
And the opening of my lips shall be right things
For my mouth shall speak truth;
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;
There is nothing froward or perverse in them
They are all plain to him that understandeth,
And right to them that find knowledge
Receive my instruction, and not silver;
And knowledge rather than choice gold
For wisdom is better than rubies;
And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it
I wisdom dwell with prudence,
And find out knowledge of witty inventions
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom:
I am understanding; I have strength
By me kings reign,
And princes decree justice
By me princes rule,
And nobles, even all the judges of the earth
I love them that love me;
And those that seek me early shall find me
Riches and honour are with me;
Yea, durable riches and righteousness
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
And my revenue than choice silver
I lead in the way of righteousness,
In the midst of the paths of judgment
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance;
And I will fill their treasures
The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,
Before his works of old
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
Or ever the earth was
When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
When there were no fountains abounding with water
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
Nor the highest part of the dust of the world
When he prepared the heavens, I was there:
When he set a compass upon the face of the depth
When he established the clouds above:
When he strengthened the fountains of the deep
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:
And I was daily his delight,
Rejoicing always before him
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;
And my delights were with the sons of men
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children:
For blessed are they that keep my ways
Hear instruction, and be wise,
And refuse it not
Blessed is the man that heareth me,
Watching daily at my gates,
Waiting at the posts of my doors
For whoso findeth me findeth life,
And shall obtain favour of the LORD
Wisdom hath builded her house,
She hath hewn out her seven pillars
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;
She hath also furnished her table
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth
Upon the highest places of the city
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him
Come, eat of my bread,
And drink of the wine which I have mingled
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame:
And he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee:
Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
And the knowledge of the holy is understanding
For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
And the years of thy life shall be increased
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself:
But if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it
A foolish woman is clamorous:
She is simple, and knoweth nothing
For she sitteth at the door of her house,
On a seat in the high places of the city
To call passengers
Who go right on their ways
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither:
And as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him
But he knoweth not that the dead are there;
And that her guests are in the depths of hell
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing:
But righteousness delivereth from death
The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
But he casteth away the substance of the wicked
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand:
But the hand of the diligent maketh rich
He that gathereth in summer is a wise son:
But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame
Blessings are upon the head of the just:
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
The memory of the just is blessed:
But the name of the wicked shall rot
The wise in heart will receive commandments:
But a prating fool shall fall
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:
But he that perverteth his ways shall be known
He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow:
But a prating fool shall fall
The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life:
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked
Hatred stirreth up strifes:
But love covereth all sins
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding
Wise men lay up knowledge:
But the mouth of the foolish is near destruction
The rich man's wealth is his strong city:
The destruction of the poor is their poverty
The labour of the righteous tendeth to life:
The fruit of the wicked to sin
He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction:
But he that refuseth reproof erreth
He that hideth hatred with lying lips,
And he that uttereth a slander, is a fool
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin:
But he that refraineth his lips is wise
The tongue of the just is as choice silver:
The heart of the wicked is little worth
The lips of the righteous feed many:
But fools die for want of wisdom
The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich,
And he addeth no sorrow with it
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief:
But a man of understanding hath wisdom
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him:
But the desire of the righteous shall be granted
As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more:
But the righteous is an everlasting foundation
As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
So is the sluggard to them that send him
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days:
But the years of the wicked shall be shortened
The hope of the righteous shall be gladness:
But the expectation of the wicked shall perish
The way of the LORD is strength to the upright:
But destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity
The righteous shall never be removed:
But the wicked shall not inhabit the earth
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom:
But the froward tongue shall be cut out
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable:
But the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness
A false balance is abomination to the LORD:
But a just weight is his delight
When pride cometh, then cometh shame:
But with the lowly is wisdom
The integrity of the upright shall guide them:
But the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them
Riches profit not in the day of wrath:
But righteousness delivereth from death
The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way:
But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness
The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them:
But transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness
When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish:
And the hope of unjust men perisheth
The righteous is delivered out of trouble,
And the wicked cometh in his stead
An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour:
But through knowledge shall the just be delivered
When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
And when the wicked perish, there is shouting
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted:
But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour:
But a man of understanding holdeth his peace
A talebearer revealeth secrets:
But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter
Where no counsel is, the people fall:
But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it:
And he that hateth suretiship is sure
A gracious woman retaineth honour:
And strong men retain riches
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh
The wicked worketh a deceitful work:
But to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward
As righteousness tendeth to life:
So he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death
They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
But such as are upright in their way are his delight
Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered
As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout,
So is a fair woman which is without discretion
The desire of the righteous is only good:
But the expectation of the wicked is wrath
There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty
The liberal soul shall be made fat:
And he that watereth shall be watered also himself
He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him:
But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it
He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour:
But he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall:
But the righteous shall flourish as a branch
He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind:
And the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
And he that winneth souls is wise
Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
Much more the wicked and the sinner
Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge:
But he that hateth reproof is brutish
A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD:
But a man of wicked devices will he condemn
A man shall not be established by wickedness:
But the root of the righteous shall not be moved
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband:
But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones
The thoughts of the righteous are right:
But the counsels of the wicked are deceit
The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood:
But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them
The wicked are overthrown, and are not:
But the house of the righteous shall stand
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom:
But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised
He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better
Than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:
But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel
He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread:
But he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding
The wicked desireth the net of evil men:
But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit
The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips:
But the just shall come out of trouble
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
And the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him
A fool's wrath is presently known:
But a prudent man covereth shame
He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness:
But a false witness deceit
There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword:
But the tongue of the wise is health
The lip of truth shall be established for ever:
But a lying tongue is but for a moment
Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil:
But to the counsellors of peace is joy
There shall no evil happen to the just:
But the wicked shall be filled with mischief
Lying lips are abomination to the LORD:
But they that deal truly are his delight
A prudent man concealeth knowledge:
But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule:
But the slothful shall be under tribute
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop:
But a good word maketh it glad
The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour:
But the way of the wicked seduceth them
The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
But the substance of a diligent man is precious
In the way of righteousness is life;
And in the pathway thereof there is no death
A wise son heareth his father's instruction:
But a scorner heareth not rebuke
A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth:
But the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence
He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:
But he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing:
But the soul of the diligent shall be made fat
A righteous man hateth lying:
But a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame
Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way:
But wickedness overthroweth the sinner
There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing:
There is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches
The ransom of a man's life are his riches:
But the poor heareth not rebuke
The light of the righteous rejoiceth:
But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out
Only by pride cometh contention:
But with the well advised is wisdom
Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished:
But he that gathereth by labour shall increase
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick:
But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life
Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed:
But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded
The law of the wise is a fountain of life,
To depart from the snares of death
Good understanding giveth favour:
But the way of transgressors is hard
Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge:
But a fool layeth open his folly
A wicked messenger falleth into mischief:
But a faithful ambassador is health
Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul:
But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil
He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:
But a companion of fools shall be destroyed
Evil pursueth sinners:
But to the righteous good shall be repaid
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just
Much food is in the tillage of the poor:
But there is that is destroyed for want of judgment
He that spareth his rod hateth his son:
But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes
The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul:
But the belly of the wicked shall want
Every wise woman buildeth her house:
But the foolish plucketh it down with her hands
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD:
But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
But the lips of the wise shall preserve them
Where no oxen are, the crib is clean:
But much increase is by the strength of the ox
A faithful witness will not lie:
But a false witness will utter lies
A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not:
But knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth
Go from the presence of a foolish man,
When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way:
But the folly of fools is deceit
Fools make a mock at sin:
But among the righteous there is favour
The heart knoweth his own bitterness;
And a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy
The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:
But the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
But the end thereof are the ways of death
Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful;
And the end of that mirth is heaviness
The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways:
And a good man shall be satisfied from himself
The simple believeth every word:
But the prudent man looketh well to his going
A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil:
But the fool rageth, and is confident
He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly:
And a man of wicked devices is hated
The simple inherit folly:
But the prudent are crowned with knowledge
The evil bow before the good;
And the wicked at the gates of the righteous
The poor is hated even of his own neighbour:
But the rich hath many friends
He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth:
But he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he
Do they not err that devise evil
But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good
In all labour there is profit:
But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury
The crown of the wise is their riches:
But the foolishness of fools is folly
A true witness delivereth souls:
But a deceitful witness speaketh lies
In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence:
And his children shall have a place of refuge
The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,
To depart from the snares of death
In the multitude of people is the king's honour:
But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince
He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding:
But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly
A sound heart is the life of the flesh:
But envy the rottenness of the bones
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker:
But he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor
The wicked is driven away in his wickedness:
But the righteous hath hope in his death
Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
But that which is in the midst of fools is made known
Righteousness exalteth a nation:
But sin is a reproach to any people
The king's favour is toward a wise servant:
But his wrath is against him that causeth shame
A soft answer turneth away wrath:
But grievous words stir up anger
The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright:
But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness
The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
Beholding the evil and the good
A wholesome tongue is a tree of life:
But perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit
A fool despiseth his father's instruction:
But he that regardeth reproof is prudent
In the house of the righteous is much treasure:
But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:
But the heart of the foolish doeth not so
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD:
But the prayer of the upright is his delight
The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:
But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness
Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:
And he that hateth reproof shall die
Hell and destruction are before the LORD:
How much more then the hearts of the children of men
A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him:
Neither will he go unto the wise
A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance:
But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken
The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
But the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness
All the days of the afflicted are evil:
But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith
A wrathful man stirreth up strife:
But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife
The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns:
But the way of the righteous is made plain
A wise son maketh a glad father:
But a foolish man despiseth his mother
Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom:
But a man of understanding walketh uprightly
Without counsel purposes are disappointed:
But in the multitude of counsellors they are established
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth:
And a word spoken in due season, how good is it
The way of life is above to the wise,
That he may depart from hell beneath
The LORD will destroy the house of the proud:
But he will establish the border of the widow
The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD:
But the words of the pure are pleasant words
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house;
But he that hateth gifts shall live
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer:
But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things
The LORD is far from the wicked:
But he heareth the prayer of the righteous
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
And a good report maketh the bones fat
The ear that heareth the reproof of life
Abideth among the wise
He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul:
But he that heareth reproof getteth understanding
The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom;
And before honour is humility
The preparations of the heart in man,
And the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD
All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
But the LORD weigheth the spirits
Commit thy works unto the LORD,
And thy thoughts shall be established
The LORD hath made all things for himself:
Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil
Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD:
Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished
By mercy and truth iniquity is purged:
And by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil
When a man's ways please the LORD,
He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him
Better is a little with righteousness
Than great revenues without right
A man's heart deviseth his way:
But the LORD directeth his steps
A divine sentence is in the lips of the king:
His mouth transgresseth not in judgment
A just weight and balance are the LORD's:
All the weights of the bag are his work
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness:
For the throne is established by righteousness
Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
And they love him that speaketh right
The wrath of a king is as messengers of death:
But a wise man will pacify it
In the light of the king's countenance is life;
And his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain
How much better is it to get wisdom than gold
And to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:
He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul
Pride goeth before destruction,
And an haughty spirit before a fall
Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly,
Than to divide the spoil with the proud
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good:
And whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he
The wise in heart shall be called prudent:
And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning
Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
But the instruction of fools is folly
The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth,
And addeth learning to his lips
Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,
Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man,
But the end thereof are the ways of death
He that laboureth laboureth for himself;
For his mouth craveth it of him
An ungodly man diggeth up evil:
And in his lips there is as a burning fire
A froward man soweth strife:
And a whisperer separateth chief friends
A violent man enticeth his neighbour,
And leadeth him into the way that is not good
He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things:
Moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass
The hoary head is a crown of glory,
If it be found in the way of righteousness
The lot is cast into the lap;
But the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD
Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
Than an house full of sacrifices with strife
The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold:
But the LORD trieth the hearts
A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
And a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
And he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished
Children's children are the crown of old men;
And the glory of children are their fathers
Excellent speech becometh not a fool:
Much less do lying lips a prince
A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
But he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends
A reproof entereth more into a wise man
Than an hundred stripes into a fool
An evil man seeketh only rebellion:
Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
Rather than a fool in his folly
Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
Evil shall not depart from his house
The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
Therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with
Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom,
Seeing he hath no heart to it
A friend loveth at all times,
And a brother is born for adversity
A man void of understanding striketh hands,
And becometh surety in the presence of his friend
He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
And he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction
He that hath a froward heart findeth no good:
And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief
He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow:
And the father of a fool hath no joy
A merry heart doeth good like a medicine:
But a broken spirit drieth the bones
A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom
To pervert the ways of judgment
Wisdom is before him that hath understanding;
But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth
A foolish son is a grief to his father,
And bitterness to her that bare him
Also to punish the just is not good,
Nor to strike princes for equity
He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
And a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit
Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
And he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding
Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh
And intermeddleth with all wisdom
A fool hath no delight in understanding,
But that his heart may discover itself
When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt,
And with ignominy reproach
The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters,
And the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook
It is not good to accept the person of the wicked,
To overthrow the righteous in judgment
A fool's lips enter into contention,
And his mouth calleth for strokes
A fool's mouth is his destruction,
And his lips are the snare of his soul
The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
He also that is slothful in his work
Is brother to him that is a great waster
The name of the LORD is a strong tower:
The righteous runneth into it, and is safe
The rich man's wealth is his strong city,
And as an high wall in his own conceit
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty,
And before honour is humility
He that answereth a matter before he heareth it,
It is folly and shame unto him
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
But a wounded spirit who can bear
The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;
And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge
A man's gift maketh room for him,
And bringeth him before great men
He that is first in his own cause seemeth just;
But his neighbour cometh and searcheth him
The lot causeth contentions to cease,
And parteth between the mighty
A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city:
And their contentions are like the bars of a castle
A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
And with the increase of his lips shall he be filled
Death and life are in the power of the tongue:
And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,
And obtaineth favour of the LORD
The poor useth intreaties;
But the rich answereth roughly
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly:
And there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother
Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity,
Than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool
Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good;
And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth
The foolishness of man perverteth his way:
And his heart fretteth against the LORD
Wealth maketh many friends;
But the poor is separated from his neighbour
A false witness shall not be unpunished,
And he that speaketh lies shall not escape
Many will intreat the favour of the prince:
And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts
He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
He that keepeth understanding shall find good
A false witness shall not be unpunished,
And he that speaketh lies shall perish
Delight is not seemly for a fool;
Much less for a servant to have rule over princes
The discretion of a man deferreth his anger;
And it is his glory to pass over a transgression
The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion;
But his favour is as dew upon the grass
A foolish son is the calamity of his father:
And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping
House and riches are the inheritance of fathers:
And a prudent wife is from the LORD
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep;
And an idle soul shall suffer hunger
He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul;
But he that despiseth his ways shall die
He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD;
And that which he hath given will he pay him again
Chasten thy son while there is hope,
And let not thy soul spare for his crying
Hear counsel, and receive instruction,
That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end
There are many devices in a man's heart;
Nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand
The desire of a man is his kindness:
And a poor man is better than a liar
A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom,
And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware:
And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge
He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother,
Is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach
Cease, my son, to hear the instruction
That causeth to err from the words of knowledge
An ungodly witness scorneth judgment:
And the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity
Judgments are prepared for scorners,
And stripes for the back of fools
The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion:
Whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul
It is an honour for a man to cease from strife:
But every fool will be meddling
The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;
But a man of understanding will draw it out
Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness:
But a faithful man who can find
The just man walketh in his integrity:
His children are blessed after him
A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment
Scattereth away all evil with his eyes
Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
I am pure from my sin
Even a child is known by his doings,
Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right
The LORD hath made even both of them
Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread
There is gold, and a multitude of rubies:
But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger:
And take a pledge of him for a strange woman
Bread of deceit is sweet to a man;
But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel
Every purpose is established by counsel:
And with good advice make war
He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
Therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips
Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness
An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning;
But the end thereof shall not be blessed
Say not thou, I will recompense evil;
But wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee
Man's goings are of the LORD;
How can a man then understand his own way
It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy,
And after vows to make enquiry
A wise king scattereth the wicked,
And bringeth the wheel over them
The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD,
Searching all the inward parts of the belly
Mercy and truth preserve the king:
And his throne is upholden by mercy
The glory of young men is their strength:
And the beauty of old men is the grey head
The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil:
So do stripes the inward parts of the belly
The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD,
As the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes:
But the LORD pondereth the hearts
To do justice and judgment
Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice
An high look, and a proud heart,
And the plowing of the wicked, is sin
The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;
But of every one that is hasty only to want
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
Is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death
The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them;
Because they refuse to do judgment
The way of man is froward and strange:
But as for the pure, his work is right
It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop,
Than with a brawling woman in a wide house
The soul of the wicked desireth evil:
His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes
The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
But God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
He also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard
A gift in secret pacifieth anger:
And a reward in the bosom strong wrath
It is joy to the just to do judgment:
But destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity
The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
Shall remain in the congregation of the dead
He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:
He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich
The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous,
And the transgressor for the upright
It is better to dwell in the wilderness,
Than with a contentious and an angry woman
There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
But a foolish man spendeth it up
He that followeth after righteousness and mercy
Findeth life, righteousness, and honour
A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
And casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
Keepeth his soul from troubles
Proud and haughty scorner is his name,
Who dealeth in proud wrath
The desire of the slothful killeth him;
For his hands refuse to labour
He coveteth greedily all the day long:
But the righteous giveth and spareth not
The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination:
How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind
A false witness shall perish:
But the man that heareth speaketh constantly
A wicked man hardeneth his face:
But as for the upright, he directeth his way
The horse is prepared against the day of battle:
But safety is of the LORD
A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,
And loving favour rather than silver and gold
The rich and poor meet together:
The LORD is the maker of them all
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself:
But the simple pass on, and are punished
By humility and the fear of the LORD
Are riches, and honour, and life
Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward:
He that doth keep his soul shall be far from them
Train up a child in the way he should go:
And when he is old, he will not depart from it
The rich ruleth over the poor,
And the borrower is servant to the lender
He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity:
And the rod of his anger shall fail
He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed;
For he giveth of his bread to the poor
Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out;
Yea, strife and reproach shall cease
He that loveth pureness of heart,
For the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge,
And he overthroweth the words of the transgressor
The slothful man saith, There is a lion without,
I shall be slain in the streets
Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;
But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him
He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches,
And he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want
Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,
And apply thine heart unto my knowledge
For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee;
They shall withal be fitted in thy lips
That thy trust may be in the LORD,
I have made known to thee this day, even to thee
Have not I written to thee excellent things
In counsels and knowledge
For the LORD will plead their cause,
And spoil the soul of those that spoiled them
Make no friendship with an angry man;
And with a furious man thou shalt not go
Lest thou learn his ways,
And get a snare to thy soul
Be not thou one of them that strike hands,
Or of them that are sureties for debts
If thou hast nothing to pay,
Why should he take away thy bed from under thee
Remove not the old landmark;
Which thy fathers have set
Seest thou a man diligent in his business
he shall stand before kings;
He shall not stand before mean men
When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
Consider diligently what is before thee
Be not desirous of his dainties:
For they are deceitful meat
Labour not to be rich:
Cease from thine own wisdom
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not
For riches certainly make themselves wings;
They fly away as an eagle toward heaven
Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,
Neither desire thou his dainty meats
The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up,
And lose thy sweet words
Speak not in the ears of a fool:
For he will despise the wisdom of thy words
And enter not into the fields of the fatherless
For their redeemer is mighty;
He shall plead their cause with thee
Apply thine heart unto instruction,
And thine ears to the words of knowledge
Withhold not correction from the child:
For if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die
Thou shalt beat him with the rod,
And shalt deliver his soul from hell
My son, if thine heart be wise,
My heart shall rejoice, even mine
Yea, my reins shall rejoice,
When thy lips speak right things
Let not thine heart envy sinners:
But be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long
For surely there is an end;
And thine expectation shall not be cut off
Be not among winebibbers;
Among riotous eaters of flesh
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty:
And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags
Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,
And despise not thy mother when she is old
Buy the truth, and sell it not;
Also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding
The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:
And he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,
And she that bare thee shall rejoice
My son, give me thine heart,
And let thine eyes observe my ways
For a whore is a deep ditch;
And a strange woman is a narrow pit
She also lieth in wait as for a prey,
And increaseth the transgressors among men
They that tarry long at the wine;
They that go to seek mixed wine
Thine eyes shall behold strange women,
And thine heart shall utter perverse things
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast
Be not thou envious against evil men,
Neither desire to be with them
For their heart studieth destruction,
And their lips talk of mischief
Through wisdom is an house builded;
And by understanding it is established
A wise man is strong;
Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength
For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war:
And in multitude of counsellors there is safety
Wisdom is too high for a fool:
He openeth not his mouth in the gate
He that deviseth to do evil
Shall be called a mischievous person
The thought of foolishness is sin:
And the scorner is an abomination to men
If thou faint in the day of adversity,
Thy strength is small
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death,
And those that are ready to be slain
My son, eat thou honey, because it is good;
And the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste
So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul:
When thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward,
And thy expectation shall not be cut off
Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
Spoil not his resting place
For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again:
But the wicked shall fall into mischief
Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
And let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth
Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him,
And he turn away his wrath from him
Fret not thyself because of evil men,
Neither be thou envious at the wicked
For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
The candle of the wicked shall be put out
My son, fear thou the LORD and the king:
And meddle not with them that are given to change
For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
And who knoweth the ruin of them both
These things also belong to the wise
It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment
He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous;
Him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him
But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
And a good blessing shall come upon them
Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause;
And deceive not with thy lips
Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me:
I will render to the man according to his work
I went by the field of the slothful,
And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding
Then I saw, and considered it well:
I looked upon it, and received instruction
A little folding of the hands to sleep
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth;
And thy want as an armed man
It is the glory of God to conceal a thing:
But the honour of kings is to search out a matter
Take away the dross from the silver,
And there shall come forth a vessel for the finer
Take away the wicked from before the king,
And his throne shall be established in righteousness
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king,
And stand not in the place of great men
Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself;
And discover not a secret to another
Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame,
And thine infamy turn not away
A word fitly spoken
Is like apples of gold in pictures of silver
As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
So is a faithful messenger to them that send him:
For he refresheth the soul of his masters
Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift
Is like clouds and wind without rain
By long forbearing is a prince persuaded,
And a soft tongue breaketh the bone
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house;
Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee
A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour
Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
And the LORD shall reward thee
The north wind driveth away rain:
So doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue
As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
So is good news from a far country
A righteous man falling down before the wicked
Is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring
It is not good to eat much honey:
So for men to search their own glory is not glory
He that hath no rule over his own spirit
Is like a city that is broken down, and without walls
As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
So honour is not seemly for a fool
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
And a rod for the fool's back
Answer not a fool according to his folly,
Lest thou also be like unto him
Answer a fool according to his folly,
Lest he be wise in his own conceit
He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage
As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
So is a parable in the mouth of fools
As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,
So is he that giveth honour to a fool
So is a parable in the mouth of fools
The great God that formed all things
Both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors
As a dog returneth to his vomit,
So a fool returneth to his folly
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit
There is more hope of a fool than of him
The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way;
A lion is in the streets
The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom;
It grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth
The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
Than seven men that can render a reason
He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,
Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears
As a mad man who casteth firebrands,
Arrows, and death
So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,
And saith, Am not I in sport
The words of a talebearer are as wounds,
And they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
Burning lips and a wicked heart
Are like a potsherd covered with silver dross
He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
And layeth up deceit within him
When he speaketh fair, believe him not:
For there are seven abominations in his heart
Whose hatred is covered by deceit,
His wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation
Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:
A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it;
And a flattering mouth worketh ruin
Boast not thyself of to morrow;
For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
A stranger, and not thine own lips
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
But a fool's wrath is heavier than them both
Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb;
But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet
As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
So is a man that wandereth from his place
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:
So doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
For better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
That I may answer him that reproacheth me
A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself;
But the simple pass on, and are punished
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger,
And take a pledge of him for a strange woman
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
It shall be counted a curse to him
A continual dropping in a very rainy day
And a contentious woman are alike
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,
And the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself
Iron sharpeneth iron;
So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof:
So he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured
As in water face answereth to face,
So the heart of man to man
Hell and destruction are never full;
So the eyes of man are never satisfied
As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold;
So is a man to his praise
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
And look well to thy herds
For riches are not for ever:
And doth the crown endure to every generation
The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself,
And herbs of the mountains are gathered
The lambs are for thy clothing,
And the goats are the price of the field
The wicked flee when no man pursueth:
But the righteous are bold as a lion
For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
But by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged
A poor man that oppresseth the poor
Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food
They that forsake the law praise the wicked:
But such as keep the law contend with them
Evil men understand not judgment:
But they that seek the LORD understand all things
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness,
Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich
Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:
But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father
He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance,
He shall gather it for him that will pity the poor
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
Even his prayer shall be abomination
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way,
He shall fall himself into his own pit:
But the upright shall have good things in possession
The rich man is wise in his own conceit;
But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out
When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory:
But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
Happy is the man that feareth alway:
But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief
As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;
So is a wicked ruler over the poor people
The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor:
But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved:
But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread:
But he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough
A faithful man shall abound with blessings:
But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent
To have respect of persons is not good:
For for a piece of bread that man will transgress
He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye,
And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife:
But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:
But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered
He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack:
But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves:
But when they perish, the righteous increase
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice:
But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father:
But he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance
The king by judgment establisheth the land:
But he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it
A man that flattereth his neighbour
Spreadeth a net for his feet
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare:
But the righteous doth sing and rejoice
The righteous considereth the cause of the poor:
But the wicked regardeth not to know it
Scornful men bring a city into a snare:
But wise men turn away wrath
If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,
Whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest
The bloodthirsty hate the upright:
But the just seek his soul
A fool uttereth all his mind:
But a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards
If a ruler hearken to lies,
All his servants are wicked
The poor and the deceitful man meet together:
The LORD lighteneth both their eyes
The king that faithfully judgeth the poor,
His throne shall be established for ever
The rod and reproof give wisdom:
But a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth:
But the righteous shall see their fall
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;
Yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul
Where there is no vision, the people perish:
But he that keepeth the law, happy is he
A servant will not be corrected by words:
For though he understand he will not answer
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words
There is more hope of a fool than of him
An angry man stirreth up strife,
And a furious man aboundeth in transgression
A man's pride shall bring him low:
But honour shall uphold the humble in spirit
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:
He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not
The fear of man bringeth a snare:
But whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe
Many seek the ruler's favour;
But every man's judgment cometh from the LORD
An unjust man is an abomination to the just:
And he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked
Surely I am more brutish than any man,
And have not the understanding of a man
I neither learned wisdom,
Nor have the knowledge of the holy
Every word of God is pure:
He is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
Add thou not unto his words,
Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar
Two things have I required of thee;
Deny me them not before I die
Remove far from me vanity and lies:
Give me neither poverty nor riches;
Feed me with food convenient for me
Accuse not a servant unto his master,
Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty
There is a generation that curseth their father,
And doth not bless their mother
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
And yet is not washed from their filthiness
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes
And their eyelids are lifted up
The eye that mocketh at his father,
And despiseth to obey his mother,
The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
And the young eagles shall eat it
There be three things which are too wonderful for me,
Yea, four which I know not
The way of an eagle in the air;
The way of a serpent upon a rock;
The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
And the way of a man with a maid
Such is the way of an adulterous woman;
She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
And saith, I have done no wickedness
For three things the earth is disquieted,
And for four which it cannot bear
For a servant when he reigneth;
And a fool when he is filled with meat
For an odious woman when she is married;
And an handmaid that is heir to her mistress
There be four things which are little upon the earth,
But they are exceeding wise
The ants are a people not strong,
Yet they prepare their meat in the summer
The conies are but a feeble folk,
Yet make they their houses in the rocks
The locusts have no king,
Yet go they forth all of them by bands
The spider taketh hold with her hands,
And is in kings' palaces
There be three things which go well,
Yea, four are comely in going
A lion which is strongest among beasts,
And turneth not away for any
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
Or if thou hast thought evil,
Lay thine hand upon thy mouth
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife
The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him
Give not thy strength unto women,
Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings
Lest they drink, and forget the law,
And pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
And wine unto those that be of heavy hearts
Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
And remember his misery no more
Open thy mouth for the dumb
In the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction
Who can find a virtuous woman
For her price is far above rubies
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her,
So that he shall have no need of spoil
She seeketh wool, and flax,
And worketh willingly with her hands
She is like the merchants' ships;
She bringeth her food from afar
She riseth also while it is yet night,
And giveth meat to her household,
And a portion to her maidens
She considereth a field, and buyeth it:
With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard
She girdeth her loins with strength,
And strengtheneth her arms
She perceiveth that her merchandise is good:
Her candle goeth not out by night
She layeth her hands to the spindle,
And her hands hold the distaff
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy
She is not afraid of the snow for her household:
For all her household are clothed with scarlet
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry;
Her clothing is silk and purple
Her husband is known in the gates,
When he sitteth among the elders of the land
She maketh fine linen, and selleth it;
And delivereth girdles unto the merchant
Strength and honour are her clothing;
And she shall rejoice in time to come
She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
And in her tongue is the law of kindness
She looketh well to the ways of her household,
And eateth not the bread of idleness
Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
Her husband also, and he praiseth her
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain:
But a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised
Give her of the fruit of her hands;
And let her own works praise her in the gates
But his delight is in the law of the LORD;
And in his law doth he meditate day and night
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
That bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
His leaf also shall not wither;
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous:
But the way of the ungodly shall perish
Why do the heathen rage,
And the people imagine a vain thing
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
The Lord shall have them in derision
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath,
And vex them in his sore displeasure
Serve the LORD with fear,
And rejoice with trembling
I laid me down and slept;
I awaked; for the LORD sustained me
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
That have set themselves against me round about
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself:
The LORD will hear when I call unto him
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
And put your trust in the LORD
Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
More than in the time that their corn and their wine increased
Give ear to my words, O LORD,
Consider my meditation
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
Neither shall evil dwell with thee
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight:
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
Their inward part is very wickedness;
Their throat is an open sepulchre;
They flatter with their tongue
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous;
With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak:
O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed
For in death there is no remembrance of thee:
In the grave who shall give thee thanks
Mine eye is consumed because of grief;
It waxeth old because of all mine enemies
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
For the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping
The LORD hath heard my supplication;
The LORD will receive my prayer
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed:
Let them return and be ashamed suddenly
O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust:
Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me
O LORD my God, if I have done this;
If there be iniquity in my hands
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
For their sakes therefore return thou on high
My defence is of God,
Which saveth the upright in heart
God judgeth the righteous,
And God is angry with the wicked every day
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity,
And hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood
He made a pit, and digged it,
And is fallen into the ditch which he made
His mischief shall return upon his own head,
And his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness:
And will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high
What is man, that thou art mindful of him
And the son of man, that thou visitest him
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
And hast crowned him with glory and honour
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
Thou hast put all things under his feet
All sheep and oxen,
Yea, and the beasts of the field
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,
And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas
O LORD our Lord,
How excellent is thy name in all the earth
When mine enemies are turned back,
They shall fall and perish at thy presence
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
Thou satest in the throne judging right
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever
But the LORD shall endure for ever:
He hath prepared his throne for judgment
And he shall judge the world in righteousness,
He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed,
A refuge in times of trouble
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:
For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them:
He forgetteth not the cry of the humble
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth:
The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands
The wicked shall be turned into hell,
And all the nations that forget God
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten:
The expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor:
Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
And blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God:
God is not in all his thoughts
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud:
Under his tongue is mischief and vanity
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den:
He lieth in wait to catch the poor:
He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net
The LORD is King for ever and ever:
The heathen are perished out of his land
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble:
Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
That the man of the earth may no more oppress
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest:
This shall be the portion of their cup
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour:
With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips,
And the tongue that speaketh proud things
For the oppression of the poor,
For the sighing of the needy,
Now will I arise, saith the LORD;
The wicked walk on every side,
When the vilest men are exalted
But I have trusted in thy mercy;
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
There were they in great fear:
For God is in the generation of the righteous
Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor,
Because the LORD is his refuge
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion
When the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people,
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad
But to the saints that are in the earth,
And to the excellent, in whom is all my delight
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
Thou maintainest my lot
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
Yea, I have a goodly heritage
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel:
My reins also instruct me in the night seasons
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
My flesh also shall rest in hope
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell;
Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal
Keep me as the apple of the eye,
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings
From the wicked that oppress me,
From my deadly enemies, who compass me about
They are inclosed in their own fat:
With their mouth they speak proudly
They have now compassed us in our steps:
They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth
Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey,
And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down:
Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
My God, my strength, in whom I will trust;
My buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower
The sorrows of death compassed me,
And the floods of ungodly men made me afraid
The sorrows of hell compassed me about:
The snares of death prevented me
In my distress I called upon the LORD,
And cried unto my God:
He heard my voice out of his temple,
And my cry came before him, even into his ears
He bowed the heavens also, and came down:
And darkness was under his feet
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:
Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
Were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them;
And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them
He sent from above, he took me,
He drew me out of many waters
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me:
For they were too strong for me
He brought me forth also into a large place;
He delivered me, because he delighted in me
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
For all his judgments were before me,
And I did not put away his statutes from me
I was also upright before him,
And I kept myself from mine iniquity
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful;
With an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure;
And with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward
For thou wilt save the afflicted people;
But wilt bring down high looks
For by thee I have run through a troop;
And by my God have I leaped over a wall
It is God that girdeth me with strength,
And maketh my way perfect
He maketh my feet like hinds' feet,
And setteth me upon my high places
He teacheth my hands to war,
So that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
That my feet did not slip
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise:
They are fallen under my feet
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies;
That I might destroy them that hate me
They cried, but there was none to save them:
Even unto the LORD, but he answered them not
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind:
I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me:
The strangers shall submit themselves unto me
The strangers shall fade away,
And be afraid out of their close places
It is God that avengeth me,
And subdueth the people under me
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen,
And sing praises unto thy name
The heavens declare the glory of God;
And the firmament sheweth his handywork
Day unto day uttereth speech,
And night unto night sheweth knowledge
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
And in keeping of them there is great reward
Who can understand his errors
Cleanse thou me from secret faults
The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble;
The name of the God of Jacob defend thee
Send thee help from the sanctuary,
And strengthen thee out of Zion
Grant thee according to thine own heart,
And fulfil all thy counsel
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:
But we will remember the name of the LORD our God
They are brought down and fallen:
But we are risen, and stand upright
Let the king hear us when we call
The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD;
And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness:
Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies:
Thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,
And their seed from among the children of men
For they intended evil against thee:
They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back,
When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength:
So will we sing and praise thy power
Our fathers trusted in thee:
They trusted, and thou didst deliver them
They cried unto thee, and were delivered:
They trusted in thee, and were not confounded
But thou art he that took me out of the womb:
Thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts
I was cast upon thee from the womb:
Thou art my God from my mother's belly
Many bulls have compassed me:
Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round
For dogs have compassed me:
The assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:
They pierced my hands and my feet
I may tell all my bones:
They look and stare upon me
They part my garments among them,
And cast lots upon my vesture
Deliver my soul from the sword;
My darling from the power of the dog
Save me from the lion's mouth:
For thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns
I will declare thy name unto my brethren:
In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee
My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation:
I will pay my vows before them that fear him
All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship:
All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him:
And none can keep alive his own soul
A seed shall serve him;
It shall be accounted to the LORD for a generation
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
He leadeth me beside the still waters
For he hath founded it upon the seas,
And established it upon the floods
Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD
Or who shall stand in his holy place
He shall receive the blessing from the LORD,
And righteousness from the God of his salvation
This is the generation of them that seek him,
That seek thy face, O Jacob
Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul
Shew me thy ways, O LORD;
Teach me thy paths
Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
For they have been ever of old
Good and upright is the LORD:
Therefore will he teach sinners in the way
The meek will he guide in judgment:
And the meek will he teach his way
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth
Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies
For thy name's sake, O LORD,
Pardon mine iniquity; for it is great
What man is he that feareth the LORD
Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose
His soul shall dwell at ease;
And his seed shall inherit the earth
The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him;
And he will shew them his covenant
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD;
For he shall pluck my feet out of the net
Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;
For I am desolate and afflicted
Look upon mine affliction and my pain;
And forgive all my sins
Consider mine enemies; for they are many;
And they hate me with cruel hatred
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me;
For I wait on thee
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes:
And I have walked in thy truth
I have not sat with vain persons,
Neither will I go in with dissemblers
I have hated the congregation of evil doers;
And will not sit with the wicked
I will wash mine hands in innocency:
So will I compass thine altar, O LORD
Gather not my soul with sinners,
Nor my life with bloody men
In whose hands is mischief,
And their right hand is full of bribes
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity:
Redeem me, and be merciful unto me
My foot standeth in an even place:
In the congregations will I bless the LORD
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice:
Have mercy also upon me, and answer me
When my father and my mother forsake me,
Then the LORD will take me up
Give them according to their deeds,
And according to the wickedness of their endeavours:
Give them after the work of their hands;
Render to them their desert
The LORD is their strength,
And he is the saving strength of his anointed
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:
Feed them also, and lift them up for ever
The voice of the LORD is powerful;
The voice of the LORD is full of majesty
The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars;
Yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon
He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire
The LORD sitteth upon the flood;
Yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever
The LORD will give strength unto his people;
The LORD will bless his people with peace
O LORD my God,
I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his,
And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me:
LORD, be thou my helper
I have hated them that regard lying vanities:
But I trust in the LORD
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy:
Thou hast set my feet in a large room
For my life is spent with grief,
And my years with sighing:
My strength faileth because of mine iniquity,
And my bones are consumed
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind:
I am like a broken vessel
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant:
Save me for thy mercies' sake
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart,
All ye that hope in the LORD
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous:
For praise is comely for the upright
Praise the LORD with harp:
Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings
Sing unto him a new song;
Play skilfully with a loud noise
He loveth righteousness and judgment:
The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap:
He layeth up the depth in storehouses
Let all the earth fear the LORD:
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him
For he spake, and it was done;
He commanded, and it stood fast
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought:
He maketh the devices of the people of none effect
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever,
The thoughts of his heart to all generations
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD;
And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
He fashioneth their hearts alike;
He considereth all their works
An horse is a vain thing for safety:
Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength
To deliver their soul from death,
And to keep them alive in famine
Our soul waiteth for the LORD:
He is our help and our shield
For our heart shall rejoice in him,
Because we have trusted in his holy name
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us,
According as we hope in thee
I will bless the LORD at all times:
His praise shall continually be in my mouth
My soul shall make her boast in the LORD:
The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad
O magnify the LORD with me,
And let us exalt his name together
I sought the LORD, and he heard me,
And delivered me from all my fears
They looked unto him, and were lightened:
And their faces were not ashamed
The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
And delivereth them
O taste and see that the LORD is good:
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him
O fear the LORD, ye his saints:
For there is no want to them that fear him
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger:
But they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing
Come, ye children, hearken unto me:
I will teach you the fear of the LORD
What man is he that desireth life,
And loveth many days, that he may see good
Depart from evil, and do good;
Seek peace, and pursue it
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,
And his ears are open unto their cry
The face of the LORD is against them that do evil,
To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth
The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth,
And delivereth them out of all their troubles
The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart;
And saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
Many are the afflictions of the righteous:
But the LORD delivereth him out of them all
He keepeth all his bones:
Not one of them is broken
The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants:
And none of them that trust in him shall be desolate
Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me:
Fight against them that fight against me
Take hold of shield and buckler,
And stand up for mine help
Let them be as chaff before the wind:
And let the angel of the LORD chase them
Let their way be dark and slippery:
And let the angel of the LORD persecute them
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
Which without cause they have digged for my soul
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD:
It shall rejoice in his salvation
They rewarded me evil for good
To the spoiling of my soul
With hypocritical mockers in feasts,
They gnashed upon me with their teeth
I will give thee thanks in the great congregation:
I will praise thee among much people
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness
And of thy praise all the day long
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
That there is no fear of God before his eyes
Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens;
And thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
And thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
For with thee is the fountain of life:
In thy light shall we see light
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee;
And thy righteousness to the upright in heart
Let not the foot of pride come against me,
And let not the hand of the wicked remove me
There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
They are cast down, and shall not be able to rise
Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
Trust in the LORD, and do good;
So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light,
And thy judgment as the noonday
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:
Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
For evildoers shall be cut off:
But those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:
Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be
But the meek shall inherit the earth;
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace
The wicked plotteth against the just,
And gnasheth upon him with his teeth
Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
And their bows shall be broken
A little that a righteous man hath is better
Than the riches of many wicked
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken:
But the LORD upholdeth the righteous
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright:
And their inheritance shall be for ever
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time:
And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied
The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again:
But the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth
For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth;
And they that be cursed of him shall be cut off
The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD:
And he delighteth in his way
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down:
For the LORD upholdeth him with his hand
He is ever merciful, and lendeth;
And his seed is blessed
Depart from evil, and do good;
And dwell for evermore
The righteous shall inherit the land,
And dwell therein for ever
The law of his God is in his heart;
None of his steps shall slide
The wicked watcheth the righteous,
The LORD will not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him when he is judged
I have seen the wicked in great power,
And spreading himself like a green bay tree
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together:
The end of the wicked shall be cut off
But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD:
He is their strength in the time of trouble
For thine arrows stick fast in me,
And thy hand presseth me sore
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
Neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head:
As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me
My wounds stink and are corrupt
Because of my foolishness
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly;
I go mourning all the day long
I am feeble and sore broken:
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me:
As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore;
And my kinsmen stand afar off
But I, as a deaf man, heard not;
And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth
Thus I was as a man that heareth not,
And in whose mouth are no reproofs
For I will declare mine iniquity;
I will be sorry for my sin
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong:
And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied
They also that render evil for good
Are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is
And now, Lord, what wait I for
My hope is in thee
Deliver me from all my transgressions:
Make me not the reproach of the foolish
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
Because thou didst it
Remove thy stroke away from me:
I am consumed by the blow of thine hand
I waited patiently for the LORD;
And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even
praise unto our God:
Many shall see it, and fear,
And shall trust in the LORD
Many, O LORD my God,
Are thy wonderful works which thou hast done,
And thy thoughts which are to us-ward:
If I would declare and speak of them,
They are more than can be numbered
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire;
Mine ears hast thou opened:
Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
I delight to do thy will, O my God:
Yea, thy law is within my heart
Let them be ashamed and confounded together
That seek after my soul to destroy it;
Let them be driven backward
and put to shame that wish me evil
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing:
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
When shall I come and appear before God
As with a sword in my bones,
While they say daily unto me,
Through thee will we push down our enemies:
Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us
For I will not trust in my bow,
Neither shall my sword save me
But thou hast saved us from our enemies,
And hast put them to shame that hated us
But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame;
And goest not forth with our armies
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy:
And they which hate us spoil for themselves
Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat;
And hast scattered us among the heathen
Thou sellest thy people for nought,
And dost not increase thy wealth by their price
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours,
A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen,
A shaking of the head among the people
My confusion is continually before me,
And the shame of my face hath covered me
For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth;
By reason of the enemy and avenger
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons,
And covered us with the shadow of death
Shall not God search this out
For he knoweth the secrets of the heart
Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
We are counted as sheep for the slaughter
Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord
Arise, cast us not off for ever
Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
And forgettest our affliction and our oppression
For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
Our belly cleaveth unto the earth
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty,
With thy glory and thy majesty
Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
Whereby the people fall under thee
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre
All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia,
Out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house
And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift;
Even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
The king's daughter is all glorious within:
Her clothing is of wrought gold
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children,
Whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
Therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
God is our refuge and strength,
A very present help in trouble
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
Though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God,
The holy place of the tabernacles of the most High
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
God shall help her, and that right early
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved:
He uttered his voice, the earth melted
The LORD of hosts is with us;
The God of Jacob is our refuge
The LORD of hosts is with us;
The God of Jacob is our refuge
For the LORD most high is terrible;
He is a great King over all the earth
He shall subdue the people under us,
And the nations under our feet
God is gone up with a shout,
The LORD with the sound of a trumpet
Sing praises to God, sing praises:
Sing praises unto our King, sing praises
For God is the King of all the earth:
Sing ye praises with understanding
God reigneth over the heathen:
God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised
In the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness
For, lo, the kings were assembled,
They passed by together
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God,
In the midst of thy temple
Walk about Zion, and go round about her:
Tell the towers thereof
My mouth shall speak of wisdom;
I will incline mine ear to a parable:
I will open my dark saying upon the harp
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
When the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about
They that trust in their wealth,
And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not:
He is like the beasts that perish
This their way is their folly:
Yet their posterity approve their sayings
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away:
His glory shall not descend after him
He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
They shall never see light
He shall call to the heavens from above,
And to the earth, that he may judge his people
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness:
For God is judge himself
I will take no bullock out of thy house,
Nor he goats out of thy folds
I know all the fowls of the mountains:
And the wild beasts of the field are mine
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee:
For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof
Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
Or drink the blood of goats
Offer unto God thanksgiving;
And pay thy vows unto the most High
Seeing thou hatest instruction,
And castest my words behind thee
Thou givest thy mouth to evil,
And thy tongue frameth deceit
Now consider this, ye that forget God,
Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity,
And cleanse me from my sin
Make me to hear joy and gladness;
That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice
Hide thy face from my sins,
And blot out all mine iniquities
Cast me not away from thy presence;
And take not thy holy spirit from me
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
And uphold me with thy free spirit
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
And sinners shall be converted unto thee
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
Build thou the walls of Jerusalem
The righteous also shall see, and fear,
And shall laugh at him
The fool hath said in his heart,
Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity:
There is none that doeth good
There were they in great fear, where no fear was:
For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
Thou hast put them to shame,
because God hath despised them
Hear my prayer, O God;
Give ear to the words of my mouth
Behold, God is mine helper:
The Lord is with them that uphold my soul
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies:
Cut them off in thy truth
Give ear to my prayer, O God;
And hide not thyself from my supplication
Attend unto me, and hear me:
I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise
Because of the voice of the enemy,
Because of the oppression of the wicked:
For they cast iniquity upon me,
And in wrath they hate me
My heart is sore pained within me:
And the terrors of death are fallen upon me
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
And horror hath overwhelmed me
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove
For then would I fly away, and be at rest
I would hasten my escape
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues:
For I have seen violence and strife in the city
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it
We took sweet counsel together,
And walked unto the house of God in company
As for me, I will call upon God;
And the LORD shall save me
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me:
For there were many with me
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him:
He hath broken his covenant
But thou,
O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
But I will trust in thee
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up:
For they be many that fight against me, O thou most High
What time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee
Every day they wrest my words:
All their thoughts are against me for evil
Shall they escape by iniquity
In thine anger cast down the people, O God
In God will I praise his word:
In the LORD will I praise his word
In God have I put my trust:
I will not be afraid what man can do unto me
Thy vows are upon me, O God:
I will render praises unto thee
I will cry unto God most high;
Unto God that performeth all things for me
He shall send from heaven, and save me
From the reproach of him that would swallow me up
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
Let thy glory be above all the earth
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people:
I will sing unto thee among the nations
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens,
And thy truth unto the clouds
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
Let thy glory be above all the earth
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
And save me from bloody men
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee:
For God is my defence
Let them wander up and down for meat,
And grudge if they be not satisfied
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing:
For God is my defence, and the God of my mercy
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things:
Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment
That thy beloved may be delivered;
Save with thy right hand, and hear me
Who will bring me into the strong city
Who will lead me into Edom
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off
And thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies
Give us help from trouble:
For vain is the help of man
Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that shall tread down our enemies
Hear my cry, O God;
Attend unto my prayer
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever:
I will trust in the covert of thy wings
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows:
Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name
Thou wilt prolong the king's life:
And his years as many generations
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,
That I may daily perform my vows
Truly my soul waiteth upon God:
From him cometh my salvation
My soul, wait thou only upon God;
For my expectation is from him
To see thy power and thy glory,
So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
When I remember thee upon my bed,
And meditate on thee in the night watches
Therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,
Shall go into the lower parts of the earth
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer:
Preserve my life from fear of the enemy
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked;
From the insurrection of the workers of iniquity
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect:
Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not
But God shall shoot at them
With an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
All that see them shall flee away
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion:
And unto thee shall the vow be performed
O thou that hearest prayer,
Unto thee shall all flesh come
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;
Being girded with power
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness;
And thy paths drop fatness
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness:
And the little hills rejoice on every side
Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands
Come and see the works of God:
He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men
O bless our God, ye people,
And make the voice of his praise to be heard
Which holdeth our soul in life,
And suffereth not our feet to be moved
Thou broughtest us into the net;
Thou laidst affliction upon our loins
I will go into thy house with burnt offerings:
I will pay thee my vows
I cried unto him with my mouth,
And he was extolled with my tongue
If I regard iniquity in my heart,
The Lord will not hear me
But verily God hath heard me;
He hath attended to the voice of my prayer
That thy way may be known upon earth,
Thy saving health among all nations
Let the people praise thee, O God;
Let all the people praise thee
Let the people praise thee, O God;
Then shall the earth yield her increase;
And God, even our own God, shall bless us
God shall bless us;
And all the ends of the earth shall fear him
Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered:
Let them also that hate him flee before him
Sing unto God,
Sing praises to his name:
Extol him that rideth upon the heavens
By his name JAH, and rejoice before him
O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people,
When thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah
Kings of armies did flee apace:
And she that tarried at home divided the spoil
When the Almighty scattered kings in it,
It was white as snow in Salmon
Why leap ye, ye high hills
This is the hill which God desireth to dwell in;
Yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever
He that is our God is the God of salvation;
And unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death
But God shall wound the head of his enemies,
And the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies,
They have seen thy goings, O God;
Even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary
The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after;
Among them were the damsels playing with timbrels
Thy God hath commanded thy strength:
Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us
Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
Shall kings bring presents unto thee
Rebuke the company of spearmen,
The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people,
Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver:
Scatter thou the people that delight in war
Princes shall come out of Egypt;
Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God
O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places:
The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people
Blessed be God
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
Shame hath covered my face
I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
And an alien unto my mother's children
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;
And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
They that sit in the gate speak against me;
And I was the song of the drunkards
Is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time:
O God, in the multitude of thy mercy
Hear me, in the truth of thy salvation
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
Deliver me because of mine enemies
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
Mine adversaries are all before thee
They gave me also gall for my meat;
And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
Pour out thine indignation upon them,
And let thy wrathful anger take hold of them
Let their habitation be desolate;
And let none dwell in their tents
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
And they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
Add iniquity unto their iniquity:
And let them not come into thy righteousness
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,
And not be written with the righteous
I will praise the name of God with a song,
And will magnify him with thanksgiving
This also shall please the LORD
Better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs
For the LORD heareth the poor,
And despiseth not his prisoners
Let the heaven and earth praise him,
The seas, and every thing that moveth therein
The seed also of his servants shall inherit it:
And they that love his name shall dwell therein
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
I am as a wonder unto many;
But thou art my strong refuge
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise
And with thy honour all the day
For mine enemies speak against me;
And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together
But I will hope continually,
And will yet praise thee more and more
I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD:
I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth:
And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works
Thou shalt increase my greatness,
And comfort me on every side
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
For they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt
Give the king thy judgments, O God,
And thy righteousness unto the king's son
He shall judge thy people with righteousness,
And thy poor with judgment
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
Throughout all generations
In his days shall the righteous flourish;
And abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
And from the river unto the ends of the earth
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;
And his enemies shall lick the dust
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him:
All nations shall serve him
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth;
The poor also, and him that hath no helper
He shall spare the poor and needy,
And shall save the souls of the needy
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
Who only doeth wondrous things
Truly God is good to Israel,
Even to such as are of a clean heart
For I was envious at the foolish,
When I saw the prosperity of the wicked
For there are no bands in their death:
But their strength is firm
They are not in trouble as other men;
Neither are they plagued like other men
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain;
Violence covereth them as a garment
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
They speak loftily
They set their mouth against the heavens,
And their tongue walketh through the earth
Therefore his people return hither:
And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them
For all the day long have I been plagued,
And chastened every morning
If I say, I will speak thus;
Behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children
Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
Then understood I their end
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places:
Thou castedst them down into destruction
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment
They are utterly consumed with terrors
So foolish was I, and ignorant:
I was as a beast before thee
Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
Thou hast holden me by my right hand
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel,
And afterward receive me to glory
Whom have I in heaven but thee
And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee
O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever
Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
The rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed;
This mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach
Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand
Pluck it out of thy bosom
For God is my King of old,
Working salvation in the midst of the earth
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces,
And gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood:
Thou driedst up mighty rivers
The day is thine, the night also is thine:
Thou hast prepared the light and the sun
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
Thou hast made summer and winter
O let not the oppressed return ashamed:
Let the poor and needy praise thy name
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause:
Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily
Forget not the voice of thine enemies:
The tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved:
I bear up the pillars of it
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
Nor from the south
But God is the judge:
He putteth down one, and setteth up another
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted
In Judah is God known:
His name is great in Israel
In Salem also is his tabernacle,
And his dwelling place in Zion
There brake he the arrows of the bow,
The shield, and the sword, and the battle
Thou art more glorious and excellent
Than the mountains of prey
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
Both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep
Thou, even thou, art to be feared:
And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry
He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
He is terrible to the kings of the earth
I Cried unto God with my voice,
Even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me
Thou holdest mine eyes waking:
I am so troubled that I cannot speak
I have considered the days of old,
The years of ancient times
I call to remembrance my song in the night:
I commune with mine own heart: And my spirit made diligent search
Will the Lord cast off for ever
And will he be favourable no more
Is his mercy clean gone for ever
Doth his promise fail for evermore
Hath God forgotten to be gracious
Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies
I will meditate also of all thy work,
And talk of thy doings
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary:
Who is so great a God as our God
Thou art the God that doest wonders:
Thou hast declared thy strength among the people
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
The sons of Jacob and Joseph
Thou leddest thy people like a flock
By the hand of Moses and Aaron
Give ear, O my people, to my law:
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth
Which we have heard and known,
And our fathers have told us
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
Turned back in the day of battle
And forgat his works,
And his wonders that he had shewed them
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt,
In the field of Zoan
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through;
And he made the waters to stand as an heap
And they sinned yet more against him
By provoking the most High in the wilderness
And they tempted God in their heart
By asking meat for their lust
Yea, they spake against God;
They said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness
Because they believed not in God,
And trusted not in his salvation
Though he had commanded the clouds from above,
And opened the doors of heaven
Man did eat angels' food:
He sent them meat to the full
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven:
And by his power he brought in the south wind
He rained flesh also upon them as dust,
And feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea
And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
Round about their habitations
For all this they sinned still,
And believed not for his wondrous works
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
And their years in trouble
When he slew them, then they sought him:
And they returned and enquired early after God
And they remembered that God was their rock,
And the high God their redeemer
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth,
And they lied unto him with their tongues
For their heart was not right with him,
Neither were they stedfast in his covenant
For he remembered that they were but flesh;
A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
And grieve him in the desert
Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
And limited the Holy One of Israel
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,
And his wonders in the field of Zoan
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
And frogs, which destroyed them
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller,
And their labour unto the locust
He destroyed their vines with hail,
And their sycomore trees with frost
He gave up their cattle also to the hail,
And their flocks to hot thunderbolts
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt;
The chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham
But made his own people to go forth like sheep,
And guided them in the wilderness like a flock
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
Even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
They were turned aside like a deceitful bow
For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
And moved him to jealousy with their graven images
When God heard this, he was wroth,
And greatly abhorred Israel
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
The tent which he placed among men
He gave his people over also unto the sword;
And was wroth with his inheritance
The fire consumed their young men;
And their maidens were not given to marriage
Their priests fell by the sword;
And their widows made no lamentation
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
And like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts:
He put them to a perpetual reproach
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph,
And chose not the tribe of Ephraim
But chose the tribe of Judah,
The mount Zion which he loved
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,
Like the earth which he hath established for ever
He chose David also his servant,
And took him from the sheepfolds
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;
And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands
We are become a reproach to our neighbours,
A scorn and derision to them that are round about us
For they have devoured Jacob,
And laid waste his dwelling place
O LORD God of hosts,
How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;
And givest them tears to drink in great measure
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours:
And our enemies laugh among themselves
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt:
Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it
She sent out her boughs unto the sea,
And her branches unto the river
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges,
So that all they which pass by the way do pluck her
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted,
And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself
It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself
Sing aloud unto God our strength:
Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob
For this was a statute for Israel,
And a law of the God of Jacob
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony,
When he went out through the land of Egypt:
Where I heard a language that I understood not
I removed his shoulder from the burden:
His hands were delivered from the pots
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me
There shall no strange god be in thee;
Neither shalt thou worship any strange god
But my people would not hearken to my voice;
And Israel would none of me
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust:
And they walked in their own counsels
I should soon have subdued their enemies,
And turned my hand against their adversaries
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him:
But their time should have endured for ever
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty;
He judgeth among the gods
Defend the poor and fatherless:
Do justice to the afflicted and needy
Arise, O God, judge the earth:
For thou shalt inherit all nations
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house:
They will be still praising thee
Blessed is the man whose strength is
in thee; In whose heart are the ways of them
They go from strength to strength,
Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer:
Give ear, O God of Jacob
Behold, O God our shield,
And look upon the face of thine anointed
LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land:
Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,
Thou hast covered all their sin
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever
Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations
Wilt thou not revive us again:
That thy people may rejoice in thee
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD,
And grant us thy salvation
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him;
That glory may dwell in our land
Mercy and truth are met together;
Righteousness and peace have kissed each other
Truth shall spring out of the earth;
And righteousness shall look down from heaven
Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good;
And our land shall yield her increase
Righteousness shall go before him;
And shall set us in the way of his steps
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me:
For I am poor and needy
For I cry unto thee daily
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer;
And attend to the voice of my supplications
Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord;
Neither are there any works like unto thy works
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things:
Thou art God alone
For great is thy mercy toward me:
And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell
His foundation is in the holy mountains
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people,
That this man was born there
For my soul is full of troubles:
And my life draweth nigh unto the grave
I am counted with them that go down into the pit:
I am as a man that hath no strength
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
In darkness, in the deeps
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead
Shall the dead arise and praise thee
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave
Or thy faithfulness in destruction
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark
And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness
Why hidest thou thy face from me
I am afflicted and ready to die
From my youth up: While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me;
Thy terrors have cut me off
They came round about me daily like water;
They compassed me about together
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,
And mine acquaintance into darkness
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever:
With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations
I have made a covenant with my chosen,
I have sworn unto David my servant
Thy seed will I establish for ever,
And build up thy throne to all generations
Thou rulest the raging of the sea:
When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
As for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them
The north and the south thou hast created them:
Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne:
Mercy and truth shall go before thy face
Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance
For the LORD is our defence;
And the Holy One of Israel is our King
I have found David my servant;
With my holy oil have I anointed him
With whom my hand shall be established:
Mine arm also shall strengthen him
The enemy shall not exact upon him;
Nor the son of wickedness afflict him
And I will beat down his foes before his face,
And plague them that hate him
I will set his hand also in the sea,
And his right hand in the rivers
He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father,
My God, and the rock of my salvation
Also I will make him my firstborn,
Higher than the kings of the earth
My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
And my covenant shall stand fast with him
His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
And his throne as the days of heaven
If his children forsake my law,
And walk not in my judgments
Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
His seed shall endure for ever,
And his throne as the sun before me
It shall be established for ever as the moon,
And as a faithful witness in heaven
But thou hast cast off and abhorred,
Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant:
Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground
Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
Thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin
All that pass by the way spoil him:
He is a reproach to his neighbours
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries;
Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice
Thou hast made his glory to cease,
And cast his throne down to the ground
The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
Thou hast covered him with shame
How long, LORD
wilt thou hide thyself for ever
Shall thy wrath burn like fire
Remember how short my time is:
Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD;
Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
For we are consumed by thine anger,
And by thy wrath are we troubled
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
We spend our years as a tale that is told
Who knoweth the power of thine anger
Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath
So teach us to number our days,
That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
And the years wherein we have seen evil
Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
And thy glory unto their children
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
And from the noisome pestilence
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
And see the reward of the wicked
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge,
Even the most High, thy habitation
There shall no evil befall thee,
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
They shall bear thee up in their hands,
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
With long life will I satisfy him,
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning,
And thy faithfulness every night
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery;
Upon the harp with a solemn sound
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work:
I will triumph in the works of thy hands
O LORD, how great are thy works
And thy thoughts are very deep
A brutish man knoweth not;
Neither doth a fool understand this
When the wicked spring as the grass,
And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
It is that they shall be destroyed for ever
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn:
I shall be anointed with fresh oil
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies,
And mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me
Those that be planted in the house of the LORD
Shall flourish in the courts of our God
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
They shall be fat and flourishing
To shew that the LORD is upright: He is my rock,
And there is no unrighteousness in him
Thy throne is established of old:
Thou art from everlasting
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
Render a reward to the proud
How long shall they utter and speak hard things
And all the workers of iniquity boast themselves
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD,
And afflict thine heritage
They slay the widow and the stranger,
And murder the fatherless
Understand, ye brutish among the people:
And ye fools, when will ye be wise
He that planted the ear, shall he not hear
He that formed the eye, shall he not see
He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct
He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know
The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man,
That they are vanity
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD,
And teachest him out of thy law
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
Until the pit be digged for the wicked
For the LORD will not cast off his people,
Neither will he forsake his inheritance
But judgment shall return unto righteousness:
And all the upright in heart shall follow it
Unless the LORD had been my help,
My soul had almost dwelt in silence
In the multitude of my thoughts within me
Thy comforts delight my soul
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
And condemn the innocent blood
But the LORD is my defence;
And my God is the rock of my refuge
O come, let us sing unto the LORD:
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving,
And make a joyful noise unto him with psalms
For the LORD is a great God,
And a great King above all gods
In his hand are the deep places of the earth:
The strength of the hills is his also
The sea is his, and he made it:
And his hands formed the dry land
O come, let us worship and bow down:
Let us kneel before the LORD our maker
Harden not your heart,
As in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness
When your fathers tempted me,
Proved me, and saw my work
O Sing unto the LORD a new song:
Sing unto the LORD, all the earth
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name;
Shew forth his salvation from day to day
Declare his glory among the heathen,
His wonders among all people
For all the gods of the nations are idols:
But the LORD made the heavens
Honour and majesty are before him:
Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness:
Fear before him, all the earth
Clouds and darkness are round about him:
Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
His lightnings enlightened the world:
The earth saw, and trembled
The heavens declare his righteousness,
And all the people see his glory
For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth:
Thou art exalted far above all gods
Light is sown for the righteous,
And gladness for the upright in heart
Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous;
And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
The LORD hath made known his salvation:
His righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth:
Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise
Sing unto the LORD with the harp;
With the harp, and the voice of a psalm
With trumpets and sound of cornet
Make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King
Let them praise thy great and terrible name;
For it is holy
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar:
They kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting;
And his truth endureth to all generations
I will sing of mercy and judgment:
Unto thee, O LORD, will I sing
A froward heart shall depart from me:
I will not know a wicked person
Hear my prayer, O LORD,
And let my cry come unto thee
For my days are consumed like smoke,
And my bones are burned as an hearth
My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;
So that I forget to eat my bread
Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
And they that are mad against me are sworn against me
For I have eaten ashes like bread,
And mingled my drink with weeping
My days are like a shadow that declineth;
And I am withered like grass
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
And favour the dust thereof
So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD,
And all the kings of the earth thy glory
When the LORD shall build up Zion,
He shall appear in his glory
He will regard the prayer of the destitute,
And not despise their prayer
This shall be written for the generation to come:
And the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
From heaven did the LORD behold the earth
To hear the groaning of the prisoner;
To loose those that are appointed to death
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion,
And his praise in Jerusalem
He weakened my strength in the way;
He shortened my days
Bless the LORD, O my soul:
And all that is within me, bless his holy name
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
And forget not all his benefits
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
Who healeth all thy diseases
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies
The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment
For all that are oppressed
He made known his ways unto Moses,
His acts unto the children of Israel
The LORD is merciful and gracious,
Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy
He will not always chide:
Neither will he keep his anger for ever
He hath not dealt with us after our sins;
Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities
As far as the east is from the west,
So far hath he removed our transgressions from us
Like as a father pitieth his children,
So the LORD pitieth them that fear him
For he knoweth our frame;
He remembereth that we are dust
As for man, his days are as grass:
As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
And the place thereof shall know it no more
To such as keep his covenant,
And to those that remember his commandments to do them
The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens;
And his kingdom ruleth over all
Who maketh his angels spirits;
His ministers a flaming fire
Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment:
The waters stood above the mountains
At thy rebuke they fled;
At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
Which sing among the branches
Where the birds make their nests:
As for the stork, the fir trees are her house
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats;
And the rocks for the conies
He appointed the moon for seasons:
The sun knoweth his going down
Thou makest darkness, and it is night:
Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth
The young lions roar after their prey,
And seek their meat from God
Man goeth forth unto his work
And to his labour until the evening
There go the ships: There is that leviathan,
Whom thou hast made to play therein
These wait all upon thee;
That thou mayest give them their meat in due season
The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever:
The LORD shall rejoice in his works
I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live:
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being
My meditation of him shall be sweet:
I will be glad in the LORD
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him:
Talk ye of all his wondrous works
Glory ye in his holy name:
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD
Seek the LORD, and his strength:
Seek his face evermore
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done;
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth
O ye seed of Abraham his servant,
Ye children of Jacob his chosen
He is the LORD our God:
His judgments are in all the earth
He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
The word which he commanded to a thousand generations
Which covenant he made with Abraham,
And his oath unto Isaac
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law,
And to Israel for an everlasting covenant
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
The lot of your inheritance
When they went from one nation to another,
From one kingdom to another people
He suffered no man to do them wrong:
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land:
He brake the whole staff of bread
He sent a man before them,
Even Joseph, who was sold for a servant
Until the time that his word came:
The word of the LORD tried him
To bind his princes at his pleasure;
And teach his senators wisdom
Israel also came into Egypt;
And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham
And he increased his people greatly;
And made them stronger than their enemies
He turned their heart to hate his people,
To deal subtilly with his servants
He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they rebelled not against his word
He turned their waters into blood,
And slew their fish
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance,
In the chambers of their kings
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,
And lice in all their coasts
He gave them hail for rain,
And flaming fire in their land
He smote their vines also and their fig trees;
And brake the trees of their coasts
He brought them forth also with silver and gold:
And there was not one feeble person among their tribes
Egypt was glad when they departed:
For the fear of them fell upon them
He spread a cloud for a covering;
And fire to give light in the night
The people asked, and he brought quails,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven
And gave them the lands of the heathen:
And they inherited the labour of the people
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Blessed are they that keep judgment,
And he that doeth righteousness at all times
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people:
O visit me with thy salvation
We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly
Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake,
That he might make his mighty power to be known
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up:
So he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
And the waters covered their enemies:
There was not one of them left
Then believed they his words;
They sang his praise
They soon forgat his works;
They waited not for his counsel
And he gave them their request;
But sent leanness into their soul
They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshipped the molten image
They forgat God their saviour,
Which had done great things in Egypt
Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
They believed not his word
But murmured in their tents,
And hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them,
To overthrow them in the wilderness
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor,
And ate the sacrifices of the dead
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions:
And the plague brake in upon them
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment:
And so the plague was stayed
And that was counted unto him for righteousness
Unto all generations for evermore
They angered him also at the waters of strife,
So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes
But were mingled among
the heathen, and learned their works
Thus were they defiled with their own works,
And went a whoring with their own inventions
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen;
And they that hated them ruled over them
Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction,
When he heard their cry
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good:
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west,
From the north, and from the south
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way;
They found no city to dwell in
Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he delivered them out of their distresses
And he led them forth by the right way,
That they might go to a city of habitation
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
For he satisfieth the longing soul,
And filleth the hungry soul with goodness
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Being bound in affliction and iron
Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And contemned the counsel of the Most High
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour;
They fell down, and there was none to help
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he saved them out of their distresses
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And brake their bands in sunder
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
For he hath broken the gates of brass,
And cut the bars of iron in sunder
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat;
And they draw near unto the gates of death
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
And he bringeth them out of their distresses
He sent his word, and healed them,
And delivered them from their destructions
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
And for his wonderful works to the children of men
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare his works with rejoicing
They that go down to the sea in ships,
That do business in great waters
These see the works of the LORD,
And his wonders in the deep
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
Which lifteth up the waves thereof
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
Their soul is melted because of trouble
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits' end
He maketh the storm a calm,
So that the waves thereof are still
Then are they glad because they be quiet;
So he bringeth them unto their desired haven
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness,
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
And praise him in the assembly of the elders
He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
And the watersprings into dry ground
A fruitful land into barrenness,
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water,
And dry ground into watersprings
And there he maketh the hungry
To dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
And suffereth not their cattle to decrease
Again, they are minished and brought low
Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow
He poureth contempt upon princes,
And causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction,
And maketh him families like a flock
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice:
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth
Whoso is wise, and will observe these things,
Even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD
O God, my heart is fixed;
I will sing and give praise, even with my glory
Awake, psaltery and harp:
I myself will awake early
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people:
And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations
For thy mercy is great above the heavens:
And thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:
And thy glory above all the earth
That thy beloved may be delivered:
Save with thy right hand, and answer me
Who will bring me into the strong city
Who will lead me into Edom
Give us help from trouble:
For vain is the help of man
Through God we shall do valiantly:
For he it is that shall tread down our enemies
For my love they are my adversaries:
But I give myself unto prayer
And they have rewarded me evil for good,
And hatred for my love
Set thou a wicked man over him:
And let Satan stand at his right hand
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned:
And let his prayer become sin
Let his days be few;
And let another take his office
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg:
Let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
And let the strangers spoil his labour
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him:
Neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children
Let his posterity be cut off;
And in the generation following let their name be blotted out
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
Let them be before the LORD continually,
That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him,
And for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD,
And of them that speak evil against my soul
For I am poor and needy,
And my heart is wounded within me
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
I am tossed up and down as the locust
My knees are weak through fasting;
And my flesh faileth of fatness
I became also a reproach unto them:
When they looked upon me they shaked their heads
That they may know that this is thy hand;
That thou, LORD, hast done it
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame,
And let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth;
Yea, I will praise him among the multitude
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor,
To save him from those that condemn his soul
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion:
Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies;
He shall wound the heads over many countries
I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation
The works of the LORD are great,
Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein
His work is honourable and glorious:
And his righteousness endureth for ever
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered:
The LORD is gracious and full of compassion
He hath given meat unto them that fear him:
He will ever be mindful of his covenant
He hath shewed his people the power of his works,
That he may give them the heritage of the heathen
The works of his hands are verity and judgment;
All his commandments are sure
He sent redemption unto his people:
He hath commanded his covenant for ever:
Holy and reverend is his name
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom:
A good understanding have all they that do his commandments:
His praise endureth for ever
Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
That delighteth greatly in his commandments
His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
The generation of the upright shall be blessed
Wealth and riches shall be in his house:
And his righteousness endureth for ever
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth:
He will guide his affairs with discretion
Surely he shall not be moved for ever:
The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
His heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
Until he see his desire upon his enemies
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor;
His righteousness endureth for ever;
His horn shall be exalted with honour
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
The desire of the wicked shall perish
Praise, O ye servants of the LORD,
Praise the name of the LORD
Blessed be the name of the LORD
From this time forth and for evermore
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
The LORD's name is to be praised
The LORD is high above all nations,
And his glory above the heavens
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
And lifteth the needy out of the dunghill
That he may set him with princes,
Even with the princes of his people
He maketh the barren woman to keep house,
And to be a joyful mother of children
When Israel went out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language
Judah was his sanctuary,
And Israel his dominion
The sea saw it, and fled:
Jordan was driven back
The mountains skipped like rams,
And the little hills like lambs
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest
Thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams;
And ye little hills, like lambs
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,
At the presence of the God of Jacob
Which turned the rock into a standing water,
The flint into a fountain of waters
But our God is in the heavens:
He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased
Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of men's hands
They have mouths, but they speak not:
Eyes have they, but they see not
They have ears, but they hear not:
Noses have they, but they smell not
They that make them are like unto them;
So is every one that trusteth in them
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD:
He is their help and their shield
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD:
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD:
He will bless them that fear
the LORD, both small and great
The LORD shall increase you more and more,
You and your children
Ye are blessed of the LORD
Which made heaven and earth
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's:
But the earth hath he given to the children of men
The dead praise not the LORD,
Neither any that go down into silence
But we will bless the LORD
From this time forth and for evermore
I love the LORD,
Because he hath heard my voice and my supplications
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me,
Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous;
Yea, our God is merciful
The LORD preserveth the simple:
I was brought low, and he helped me
Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
For the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee
I will walk before
The LORD in the land of the living
What shall I render unto the LORD
For all his benefits toward me
I will take the cup of salvation,
And call upon the name of the LORD
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
And will call upon the name of the LORD
O praise the LORD,
All ye nations: Praise him, all ye people
For his merciful kindness is great toward us:
And the truth of the LORD endureth for ever
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
The LORD is on my side;
I will not fear: What can man do unto me
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me:
Therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall:
But the LORD helped me
The LORD is my strength and song,
And is become my salvation
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous:
The right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly
I shall not die, but live,
And declare the works of the LORD
The LORD hath chastened me sore:
But he hath not given me over unto death
Open to me the gates of righteousness:
I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD
This gate of the LORD,
Into which the righteous shall enter
I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me,
And art become my salvation
The stone which the builders refused
Is become the head stone of the corner
This is the LORD's doing;
It is marvellous in our eyes
This is the day which the LORD hath made;
We will rejoice and be glad in it
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee:
Thou art my God, I will exalt thee
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
Blessed are the undefiled in the way,
Who walk in the law of the LORD
Blessed are they that keep his testimonies,
And that seek him with the whole heart
They also do no iniquity:
They walk in his ways
Thou hast commanded us
To keep thy precepts diligently
Then shall I not be ashamed,
When I have respect unto all thy commandments
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart,
When I shall have learned thy righteous judgments
I will keep thy statutes:
O forsake me not utterly
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way
By taking heed thereto according to thy word
With my whole heart have I sought thee:
O let me not wander from thy commandments
Thy word have I hid in mine heart,
That I might not sin against thee
Blessed art thou, O LORD:
Teach me thy statutes
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies,
As much as in all riches
I will meditate in thy precepts,
And have respect unto thy ways
Deal bountifully with thy servant,
That I may live, and keep thy word
I am a stranger in the earth:
Hide not thy commandments from me
Princes also did sit and speak against me:
But thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
Thy testimonies also are
My delight and my counsellors
My soul melteth for heaviness:
Strengthen thou me according unto thy word
Remove from me the way of lying:
And grant me thy law graciously
I will run the way of thy commandments,
When thou shalt enlarge my heart
Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes;
And I shall keep it unto the end
Make me to go in the path of thy commandments;
For therein do I delight
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies,
And not to covetousness
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity;
And quicken thou me in thy way
Stablish thy word
Unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear
Behold, I have longed after thy precepts:
Quicken me in thy righteousness
Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD,
Even thy salvation, according to thy word
So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
For I trust in thy word
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth;
For I have hoped in thy judgments
So shall I keep
thy law continually for ever and ever
And I will walk at liberty:
For I seek thy precepts
I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings,
And will not be ashamed
And I will delight myself
In thy commandments, which I have loved
Remember the word unto thy servant,
Upon which thou hast caused me to hope
This is my comfort in my affliction:
For thy word hath quickened me
The proud have had me greatly in derision:
Yet have I not declined from thy law
I remembered thy judgments of old,
O LORD; And have comforted myself
Horror hath taken hold upon me
Because of the wicked that forsake thy law
Thy statutes have been my songs
In the house of my pilgrimage
Thou art my portion, O LORD:
I have said that I would keep thy words
I intreated thy favour with my whole heart:
Be merciful unto me according to thy word
I thought on my ways,
And turned my feet unto thy testimonies
I made haste, and delayed not
To keep thy commandments
The bands of the wicked have robbed me:
Yet do I not forget thy law
At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee
Because of thy righteous judgments
I am a companion of all them
That fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts
The earth, O LORD, is full of
Thy mercy: Teach me thy statutes
Thou hast dealt well with thy servant,
O LORD, according unto thy word
Before I was afflicted I went astray:
But now have I kept thy word
The proud have forged a lie against me:
But I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart
Their heart is as fat as grease;
But I delight in thy law
It is good for me that I have been afflicted;
That I might learn thy statutes
The law of thy mouth is better unto me
Than thousands of gold and silver
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:
Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments
They that fear thee will be glad when they see me;
Because I have hoped in thy word
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live:
For thy law is my delight
Let those that fear thee turn unto me,
And those that have known thy testimonies
My soul fainteth for thy salvation:
But I hope in thy word
For I am become like a bottle in the smoke;
The proud have digged pits for me,
Which are not after thy law
They had almost consumed me upon earth;
But I forsook not thy precepts
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations:
Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth
They continue this day according to thine ordinances:
For all are thy servants
Unless thy law had been my delights,
I should then have perished in mine affliction
I will never forget thy precepts:
For with them thou hast quickened me
I am thine, save me;
For I have sought thy precepts
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me:
But I will consider thy testimonies
I have seen an end of all perfection:
But thy commandment is exceeding broad
O how love I thy law
It is my meditation all the day
Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies:
For they are ever with me
I have more understanding than all my teachers:
For thy testimonies are my meditation
I understand more than the ancients,
Because I keep thy precepts
I have not departed
From thy judgments: For thou hast taught me
How sweet are thy words unto my taste
Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
And a light unto my path
I have sworn, and I will perform it,
That I will keep thy righteous judgments
My soul is continually in my hand:
The wicked have laid a snare for me:
Yet I erred not from thy precepts
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever:
For they are the rejoicing of my heart
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
Alway, even unto the end
I hate vain thoughts:
But thy law do I love
Thou art my hiding place and my shield:
I hope in thy word
Depart from me, ye evildoers:
For I will keep the commandments of my God
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe:
And I will have respect unto thy statutes continually
Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
Therefore I love thy testimonies
My flesh trembleth for fear of thee;
And I am afraid of thy judgments
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation,
And for the word of thy righteousness
It is time for thee, LORD, to work:
For they have made void thy law
Therefore I love thy commandments
Above gold; yea, above fine gold
Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
And I hate every false way
Thy testimonies are wonderful:
Therefore doth my soul keep them
The entrance of thy words giveth light;
It giveth understanding unto the simple
I opened my mouth, and panted:
For I longed for thy commandments
Order my steps in thy word:
And let not any iniquity have dominion over me
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;
And teach me thy statutes
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes,
Because they keep not thy law
Righteous art thou, O LORD,
And upright are thy judgments
Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded
are righteous and very faithful
My zeal hath consumed me,
Because mine enemies have forgotten thy words
Thy word is very pure:
Therefore thy servant loveth it
I am small and despised:
Yet do not I forget thy precepts
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
And thy law is the truth
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me:
Yet thy commandments are my delights
The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting:
Give me understanding, and I shall live
I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried:
I hoped in thy word
Mine eyes prevent the night watches,
That I might meditate in thy word
They draw nigh that follow after mischief:
They are far from thy law
Thou art near, O LORD;
And all thy commandments are truth
Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old
That thou hast founded them for ever
Consider mine affliction, and deliver me:
For I do not forget thy law
Plead my cause, and deliver me:
Quicken me according to thy word
Salvation is far from the wicked:
For they seek not thy statutes
Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD:
Quicken me according to thy judgments
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies;
Yet do I not decline from thy testimonies
I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved;
Because they kept not thy word
Thy word is true from the beginning:
And every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever
Princes have persecuted me without a cause:
But my heart standeth in awe of thy word
I rejoice at thy word,
As one that findeth great spoil
I hate and abhor lying:
But thy law do I love
Seven times a day do I praise thee
Because of thy righteous judgments
Great peace have they which love thy law:
And nothing shall offend them
LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation,
And done thy commandments
My soul hath kept thy testimonies;
And I love them exceedingly
I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies:
For all my ways are before thee
Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD:
Give me understanding according to thy word
Let my supplication come before thee:
Deliver me according to thy word
My lips shall utter praise,
When thou hast taught me thy statutes
My tongue shall speak of thy word:
For all thy commandments are righteousness
Let thine hand help me;
For I have chosen thy precepts
I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD;
And thy law is my delight
In my distress
I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips,
And from a deceitful tongue
What shall be given unto thee
or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech,
That I dwell in the tents of Kedar
I am for peace:
But when I speak, they are for war
My help cometh from the LORD,
Which made heaven and earth
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
He that keepeth thee will not slumber
The LORD is thy keeper:
The LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand
The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil:
He shall preserve thy soul
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in
From this time forth, and even for evermore
Jerusalem is builded
As a city that is compact together
For there are set thrones of judgment,
The thrones of the house of David
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
They shall prosper that love thee
Peace be within thy walls,
And prosperity within thy palaces
Because of the house of the LORD our God
I will seek thy good
Behold, as the eyes of servants
Look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress;
So our eyes wait upon the LORD our God,
Until that he have mercy upon us
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,
And with the contempt of the proud
Then they had swallowed us up quick,
When their wrath was kindled against us
Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
The stream had gone over our soul
Blessed be the LORD,
Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth
Our help is in the name of the LORD,
Who made heaven and earth
When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream
The LORD hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad
Turn again our captivity, O LORD,
As the streams in the south
They that sow in tears
Shall reap in joy
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him
Except the LORD build the house,
They labour in vain that build it:
Except the LORD keep the city,
The watchman waketh but in vain
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD:
And the fruit of the womb is his reward
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;
So are children of the youth
Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD;
That walketh in his ways
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion:
And thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children,
And peace upon Israel
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth,
May Israel now say
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth:
Yet they have not prevailed against me
The LORD is righteous:
He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
Which withereth afore it groweth up
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand;
Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom
Let thine ears be attentive
To the voice of my supplications
But there is forgiveness with thee,
That thou mayest be feared
Let Israel hope in the LORD
From henceforth and for ever
How he sware unto the LORD,
And vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house,
Nor go up into my bed
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah:
We found it in the fields of the wood
We will go into his tabernacles:
We will worship at his footstool
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest;
Thou, and the ark of thy strength
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
And let thy saints shout for joy
He will not turn from it;
Of the fruit of thy body
Will I set upon thy throne
For the LORD hath chosen Zion;
He hath desired it for his habitation
I will abundantly bless her provision:
I will satisfy her poor with bread
I will also clothe her priests with salvation:
And her saints shall shout aloud for joy
There will I make the horn of David to bud:
I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed
As the dew of Hermon,
And as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion:
For there the LORD commanded the blessing,
Even life for evermore
Behold, bless ye the LORD,
All ye servants of the LORD,
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving;
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary,
And bless the LORD
The LORD that made heaven and earth
Bless thee out of Zion
Praise ye the name of the LORD;
Praise him, O ye servants of the LORD
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD,
In the courts of the house of our God
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself,
And Israel for his peculiar treasure
For I know that the LORD is great,
And that our Lord is above all gods
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt,
Both of man and beast
Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever;
And thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations
For the LORD will judge his people,
And he will repent himself concerning his servants
They have mouths, but they speak not;
Eyes have they, but they see not
They that make them are like unto them:
So is every one that trusteth in them
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel:
Bless the LORD, O house of Aaron
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi:
Ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion,
Which dwelleth at Jerusalem
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
O give thanks unto the God of gods:
O give thanks to the Lord of lords:
To him who alone doeth great wonders:
To him that by wisdom made the heavens:
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters:
To him that made great lights:
The sun to rule by day:
The moon and stars to rule by night:
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn:
And brought out Israel from among them:
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm:
To him which divided the Red sea into parts:
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it:
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea:
To him which led his people through the wilderness:
To him which smote great kings:
Sihon king of the Amorites:
And Og the king of Bashan:
And gave their land for an heritage:
For his mercy endureth for ever
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant:
Who remembered us in our low estate:
And hath redeemed us from our enemies:
Who giveth food to all flesh:
O give thanks unto the God of heaven:
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
When we remembered Zion
How shall we sing
The LORD's song in a strange land
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
Let my right hand forget her cunning
Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
Against the stones
I will praise thee with my whole heart:
Before the gods will I sing praise unto thee
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me,
And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD,
When they hear the words of thy mouth
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD:
For great is the glory of the LORD
Thou compassest my path and my lying down,
And art acquainted with all my ways
For there is not a word in my tongue,
But, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether
Thou hast beset me behind and before,
And laid thine hand upon me
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
It is high, I cannot attain unto it
Whither shall I go from thy spirit
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there
Even there shall thy hand lead me,
And thy right hand shall hold me
For thou hast possessed my reins:
Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God
How great is the sum of them
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God:
Depart from me therefore, ye bloody men
For they speak against thee wickedly,
And thine enemies take thy name in vain
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee
I hate them with perfect hatred:
I count them mine enemies
Search me, O God, and know my heart:
Try me, and know my thoughts
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart;
Continually are they gathered together for war
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent;
Adders' poison is under their lips
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle
As for the head of those that compass me about,
Let the mischief of their own lips cover them
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth:
Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
And the right of the poor
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
The upright shall dwell in thy presence
LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me;
Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;
And the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth;
Keep the door of my lips
Let the righteous smite me;
It shall be a kindness: And let him reprove me;
It shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head:
For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
When their judges are overthrown in stony places,
They shall hear my words; for they are sweet
I cried unto the LORD with my voice;
With my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication
I poured out my complaint before him;
I shewed before him my trouble
Attend unto my cry;
For I am brought very low:
Deliver me from my persecutors;
For they are stronger than I
Bring my soul out of prison,
That I may praise thy name:
The righteous shall compass me about;
For thou shalt deal bountifully with me
And enter not into judgment with thy servant:
For in thy sight shall no man living be justified
I stretch forth my hands unto thee:
My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies:
I flee unto thee to hide me
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him
Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him
Man is like to vanity:
His days are as a shadow that passeth away
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down:
Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them:
Shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them
Whose mouth speaketh vanity,
And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God:
Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings:
Who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword
Happy is that people, that is in such a case:
Yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD
Every day will I bless thee;
And I will praise thy name for ever and ever
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
And his greatness is unsearchable
I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty,
And of thy wondrous works
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts:
And I will declare thy greatness
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
And shall sing of thy righteousness
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion;
Slow to anger, and of great mercy
The LORD is good to all:
And his tender mercies are over all his works
All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD;
And thy saints shall bless thee
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,
And talk of thy power
The LORD upholdeth all that fall,
And raiseth up all those that be bowed down
The eyes of all wait upon thee;
And thou givest them their meat in due season
Thou openest thine hand,
And satisfiest the desire of every living thing
The LORD is righteous in all his ways,
And holy in all his works
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
To all that call upon him in truth
The LORD preserveth all them that love him:
But all the wicked will he destroy
Praise the LORD, O my soul
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man,
In whom there is no help
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth;
In that very day his thoughts perish
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
Whose hope is in the LORD his God
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed:
Which giveth food to the hungry
The LORD looseth the prisoners
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind:
The LORD raiseth them that are bowed down:
The LORD loveth the righteous
The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion,
Unto all generations
The LORD doth build up Jerusalem:
He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel
He healeth the broken in heart,
And bindeth up their wounds
He telleth the number of the stars;
He calleth them all by their names
Great is our Lord, and of great power:
His understanding is infinite
The LORD lifteth up the meek:
He casteth the wicked down to the ground
Sing praise upon the harp unto our God
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
In those that hope in his mercy
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem;
Praise thy God, O Zion
He maketh peace in thy borders,
And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth:
His word runneth very swiftly
He giveth snow like wool:
He scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes
He casteth forth his ice like morsels:
Who can stand before his cold
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them:
He causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow
He sheweth his word unto Jacob,
His statutes and his judgments unto Israel
He hath not dealt so with any nation:
And as for his judgments, they have not known them
Praise ye him, all his angels:
Praise ye him, all his hosts
Praise ye him, sun and moon:
Praise him, all ye stars of light
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens,
And ye waters that be above the heavens
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever:
He hath made a decree which shall not pass
Praise the LORD from the earth,
Ye dragons, and all deeps
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours;
Stormy wind fulfilling his word
Beasts, and all cattle;
Creeping things, and flying fowl
Kings of the earth, and all people;
Princes, and all judges of the earth
Let them praise the name of the LORD:
For his name alone is excellent;
His glory is above the earth and heaven
He also exalteth the horn of his people,
The praise of all his saints;
Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him
Sing unto the LORD a new song,
And his praise in the congregation of saints
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him:
Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King
Let them praise his name in the dance:
Let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people:
He will beautify the meek with salvation
Let the saints be joyful in glory:
Let them sing aloud upon their beds
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
And a twoedged sword in their hand
To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
And punishments upon the people
To bind their kings with chains,
And their nobles with fetters of iron
To execute upon them the judgment written:
This honour have all his saints
Praise God in his sanctuary:
Praise him in the firmament of his power
Praise him for his mighty acts:
Praise him according to his excellent greatness
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet:
Praise him with the psaltery and harp
Praise him upon the loud cymbals:
Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals
And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband
Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah
The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband
Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept
When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her
And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab
Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee
Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking
And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her
And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet
And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman
And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I
Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it
And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city
And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter
And she told her all that the man had done to her
And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi
And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it
