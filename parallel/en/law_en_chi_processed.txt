They're men who don't understand.
They're stubborn, they're cocky, they despise old men.
They live like apes in trees.
They live like buffaloes in the woods.

Offense of a village elder 2 
Old as a daisy,
Like the water fig tree,
Adults in the upper neighbourhood all glasses 
The kids downstairs heard,
He's a man who doesn't know what's right and what's left.
He was like a headless snake,
He was like a buffalo out of a rope.
The old man taught him to argue,
The villager warned him to point,
He put on his proud face,
He let go of insolence,
They say he doesn't listen.
People advised him, he didn't.
He thinks he's as tall as the sky.

His sins must be paid with a buffalo,
His fault must be paid off with a cow,
If there's no buffalo, if there's no cattle,
An unfair trial,
He's forgotten his sense of right and wrong.
He lost his head to look at,
Because he missed eating with a man no one sees in the day,
Because he's been drinking in the dark and no one's watching.
So now he wants the sun at night,
So now he wants the night in the day,
He's laid out the deer's path.
He's given the deer a way out.
Now he who bears blame, who escapes,
His crime must be brought to trial.
Village elders violate the customary law
Village rules must be remembered, village rules must be kept 
Daughter makes a mistake, the village elder must say,
Sons make mistakes, the village elders have to...
The head of the village is like a fig tree at the head of a stream, like a daisy tree at the head of a stream,
The road, the right turn, the wrong thing, the right thing to know,
And now the old man forgets the way, the wrong turn,
Unspoken nights, unspoken days?
So he's very guilty of the village,

Make the village fig tree dry 
A trial must be brought between the wrong man and him.
He who listens to the incitement of others,
The fortune teller measured the sticks to make him believe,
Witches watching candles make him follow,
Woman talkative. He's right.
The bad man who instigated it all heard,
The wild banyan tree he didn't look for,
There's a fig tree upstream he can't find.
His grandparents ignored it, too.
His mother and father left him, too.
He's like a little puddle that's been slapped over.
He's like a geyser that's been blocked by men.
As a stream flows according to his will,
Crazy dogs are trapped by people.
The black crow is tired of corn,
The hawk is tired of fresh meat,
Poison arrow in the chest can't escape.
The provocations of men, the words he hears,
He's like a guy who craves a swab, son.
He's like the guy who wants his daughter's bucket.
The desire for the salt of the Kinh, but the laziness to change,
Fancy a rich but lazy grower's cigarette,
He thought there was a way to go.
Running with your legs, holding with your hands,
He thought it was right to say it, good to do it.
He's got ears, but he's deaf. He's got a head, but he thinks wrong.
He's like a young bamboo that he can bend.
He's like old bamboo for a man to straighten an axe.
His eyes don't see what's right.
His ears don't recognize what's wrong.
His head was as delirious as a girl's.
His mother didn't recognize it.
His father's words are no longer known.
The bad man's words he hears he remembers,
So he's guilty.
Guilty of insolence.
Thirsty, they gave him water,
They're starving and feeding.
Craving salt, they feed it with salt.
It's cold. They're warming up.
So they told me to go, so they told me to do 
Wrong thing they say right, right thing they say wrong,
The old man at home won't ask,
His parents won't let him,
He talks like a madman, acts like a drunk,
When they're punished, they're arrested.
He made it together. He took it together.
Because he's just a worker,
Everything's on their minds.
Everything was done by them.
When the seeds get stuck in the pot 
When the bucket got stuck to my back,
Fire needs to be extinguished.
The running water needs to be drained.
If you turn a blind eye,
Wine must be opened, chickens and pigs must be chopped.
Contempt of the elderly, parents 1 
Fish in the water, tiger in the forest 
In the forest tiger is considered father,
Underwater fish are often called mothers.
Your mother gave birth to me,
You raised him to be a man.
My back warms my breasts,
Father's hand raises water baby's feet from small
Eat flexible rice also from mother's hand 
Barbecued wild meat also from the father's bow 
The enemy threatened me with no father,
Rich people despise their mothers.
The leader died a slave,
Adult absent from home defendant spared 
Old villagers die, villagers rummage,
Now he's as big as a tree,
Firm hunting, good biceps.
Bright eyes, straight back, loud words 
Seeing the old man rolling his eyes,
Seeing the little ones it dispels.
Grandparents health as branches ktu withered 
Thin father, thin mother, she didn't care.
He didn't even bother to look,
His ears can't hear, his eyes can't see.
You're like a deer in an arrow,
She was sullen as a ship withered leaves,
As I grew older, my eyes grew dim, my legs trembled 
He curses him like an evil master to a slave,
He's sad, she's miserable,
Father despised, mother despised
Contempt for the elderly, parents 2 
Your head looks like it's peeling.
His grandmother's like wild meat with maggots.
His father's heels prevented him from stepping,
Her mother's hand stopped her from shimmering.
Words and voices, they don't help.
Day likes elephant riding, night likes horse racing.
The stairs of the noon man want to cut.
Kitchen widow wants to kick 
Likes to kick the mat, touch the wife's blanket
It's higher than Mount Lung Kong.
It's deeper than the river.
Sad family, miserable family.
The villagers laughed, the neighbors complained 
Villagers despise like shrews 
Friends are as far away as maggots in dung heap 
I have to apologize for your forgiveness. I have to apologize for your forgiveness.
I have to apologize so Dad doesn't get angry, I have to apologize so Mom doesn't get hurt.
Big mistakes pay off with female pigs.
Small errors must be rubbed with a boar 
The filth must be washed with alcohol 
Big cross must open the leaf for big errors, small cross forbid need to dispel small errors 
Open mouth to ask for forgiveness,
Righteousness to show what is right and wrong.
Let your grandparents walk upright, let my mother walk straight,
The man under the man above the man greets,
The villagers ignored him, and the gods ceased to be angry.
The execution of non-payment of fines 
The boar's feathers are clean, and the wine has faded.
The stove burned, the ashes,
What's been done, what's been done...
The right and the wrong are clear.
Accepted by both parties
The chicken has been cut, the pig has been plucked,
The monkey, the dead ape,
Why did you bring it up to the tree when he was dead?
Why is the cow avoiding the banana dust,
The fish that avoids the springs
The matter was settled, he heard and saw,
Make him pay, but he won't pay.
Wealth under one must double.
Penalty property must double.
The sin of invoking the children or the slaves of others,
The man who snatched the handle from the hoe, the hilt from the knife,
He commanded his daughters to leave the porch,
Gave son to leave the floor,,
Giving a wife a dress, leaving her husband,
Warm blankets off the heels, 
Double chamber triple chamber wear wind lay
Three-eyed children who do not see clearly,
Children who are not yet wise at the seventh head,
Young belly not old boy,
The young girl's heart is still young.
The river's flowing. He's blocking the flow.
The trees are up, he's up, he's annoying,,
Termites go in packs, swords in swarms.
The immature banana that he broke off,,
The flower has not yet bloomed, and he breaks the tops,
The wine had not yet faded, and he hastened to withdraw it.
Filled with water, he got to his feet.
Unripe rice he came to turn off the stove,
Unripe meat he hurriedly smashed the cylinders,
The termite in his field went to the bottom,
Seven have his master come and fetch the deer,
There's no one he's going to spit on.
His son's slave ravens the deep woods,
His slave girl tricked him into a shallow stream,
He'd spit moose horns out of his head.
The rhinoceros horn on his forehead,
To take ivory from a rich man's hand,
The bucket with the man's lid open, 
The man's door was broken down.
The towel on the woman's head he jerked,
The man's hips are down.
I was on his mother's back, snatching him up.
He sees no Bok Kong, no yang high and low,,
Never mind the Jrai on horseback,
Disdainful Man Nong on elephant backs,
When the Bih had a mouth, and the Stieng had long ears,,
He's a man who comes in at noon and makes ends meet.
Evening comes to put out fires with fearless water,
So he's a guilty man.
For the crime of harboring strangers, slaves or other prisoners,
Spring tree for shade when taking water, 
The fig tree at the top of the village stands as a support.
He watches over the villagers in the morning and evening,
A place to serve rice when hungry, a place to offer water when thirsty 
Now the banyan tree changes direction, the fig tree changes shade,
Offer the meal of the sinner unknown, and the water of the sinner unknown,
Little things go quietly, big things go quietly,
Just shut up like a turtle that hears thunder.
Slaves, prisoners need to report,
The girl who walks by night, and the boy who walks by day, must believe.
A man who trades in gongs must know, and a woman who sells salt must investigate,
Poor people have to give up alcohol, too.
The villager awkwardly peeled the bark from the trees.
The villager's footsteps are slow now,
It's not going to work out.
Don't remember the rules for dividing meat into alcoholic dung,
No longer know how to offer dinner, wine,,
The stranger grows accustomed to it,
A slave or a shepherd of field buffaloes,
The night of blue rice brought up the fields, the day of water meat brought the edge of the forest,
Little things nobody knows nobody knows,,
Sticks you don't trust, teachers you don't invite,
There's never been such a scandal before.
The gods will go, the demons will come,,
Dry rivers, shallow streams, withered forests,
Human heart hurts, human love divides, 
The villagers of bald hills no longer know,
The crime of the first guest, the crime of the second.
The crime of drunken people,
Drinking alcohol should watch the cang, 
Eating blue rice should watch the tube, 
Eating meat on the node should watch the portion, 
The neighbors above invited but could not eat,
The village below offers drinks but does not know how to drink,
Suctioning shallow water does not know to stop,
Eating the flesh without looking at it,
Yeasty yeast, ringing ears, red eyes like the eyes of a grech that eats bamboo flowers,
Red as a summer buffalo running up the hill,
Itchy feet of wild horses running down the swamp,
drunkenly walking in front of him, unable to find his way,
He's a woman who eats without thinking. He's a man who drinks without stopping.
There's no sadness in the house when he knocks.
Big gongs at the top of the house, his floor shaking, small gongs by the fire, he played,
The wine cup needs his feet to kick his hands to shake,
Big thighs he kicks old people, little thighs he steps young people, wears,
His grandmother's words, his father's words, his mother's words...
The old man didn't mind.
He's coming at me like a mad dog.
He's looking for trouble like a maniac.
His ears have deaf rims, and his head has bald hair.
He's got blind sockets in his eyes.
Hot temper like fire spread grass painting sunshine season,,
As strong as a newborn wolf.
Like a queen snake laying eggs,
His teeth bite, his hands tear, his mouth screams,
His body punched, his face slapped,
Bloody nose, missing molars, 
Early on his grandparents cursed in his face,
His parents yelled at him day and night,
Beat his wife, whipped his children,
The soup is boiling, he sneezes, the rice is cooking, he turns off the stove.
His crime was not to eat enough to be full, not to have enough sleep, to shake,,
The empty house he came to shake himself, the gong of his people,
The rich, the luxurious he doesn't care.
He was entangled as high as a treeless mountain,
His faults are as long as the river Krong Ayun in the rainy season, 
His life he took, he paid for it.
The blood of the man who sprinkled him with pigs,
If his ears ring, he gives them chickens.
Prohibited liquor, his mouth open or,
He had to touch the old man's pipe.
The crime committed by a madman,
Wanderers like summer mad buffalo,,
Morning to the east village, evening to the west village.
Day laugh, night cry no longer know, 
The soul is rebuked by yang,
Unlit eyes are punished by yang atâo, 
His head lost its sense of right and wrong, his heart lost its sense of pity.
His mouth no longer speaks the right words,
The porch floor was full of footsteps, and the kitchen floor was broken by his hands.
Talk to your father, talk to your mother.
The old man he curses, the young man he beats,
Your grandparents taught you that,
When the mother gong beats the wrong beat, the wrong drum, the wrong drum, the gong stops crying,
The cup of dry wine, which the weaver needs,
Rice burnt by the fire-maker, shallow water by no water-monger,,
Dead animals are hunted by hunters.
The stallion who broke his bridle was led by a shepherd, and the mare who broke his bridle was led by a stable owner.
A mad buffalo who risks his life,
He's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy, he's crazy.
Crazy men mom must keep at home, crazy women daddy must,
Sick old people grandchildren have to hold hands, children hurt grandparents 
Over here, he's crazy. Why didn't you look, he's crazy?
His thighs kick the old man's body, his biceps threaten the young,
His mother suffered, his father suffered.
Alcohol needs to be opened, chickens must be chopped,,
Sins need to be discussed, faults need to be made clear,.
Villages up and down need to know,
Don't dance like a crazy man, don't talk like a crazy man, near fire,,
Decaying plants should not be split with an ax, dry paintings should not be left 
Meat with a smell should not be further submerged in water, 
" A male slave shall not strike with a rope, nor a female slave with a rattan whip;
Old people shouldn't climb slopes.
Sick people should not eat too much, 
Crazy people should be careful,
Don't let the buffalo run wild in the summer.
His father shouldn't have let mad dogs out of his cage.
Lazy sins do not worry about making 1.
Hanging out, wandering,
He's like a headless snake, like a buffalo out of a rope,
He's overrunning the village in the winter.
He's pushing through the western villages out of season,
In the rainy season he did not pick at the rice,
No sign of him in the next sunny season,
Father hungry, mother thirsty, poor children he doesn't care,
He's got a hand that won't go down the garbage chute,
He has strong legs and doesn't know how to go to the forest to hunt.
Just hanging out and playing around.
Like a stray buffalo, like a stray cow,
He's got a bad reputation in the house.
He's got a bad reputation in the village.
The stubborn one said no, said no.
The sin of not repenting, the sin of not accepting,
He must be driven out of the village.
Lazy sins do not worry about making 2.
The sun was on his father's back and he couldn't see.
His mother's back was turned away from him.
Under the bushes he sings he sings 
Brothers sweat from picking up trees.
The shade of the trees is cool, it pulls, the soil is hard, it does not end, the trees are hard, it does not bother to cut,
It came back in a couple of days.
Treat the field like a place of maggots, a place of manure, and spread the grass like a turtle.
Carrying water he doesn't care, chopping wood he doesn't touch,
It throws, it throws the bat.
He said his back hurts.
Before the water could be offered, the water ran dry.
Before you can offer the rice, the rice is gone.
Before I could mention it, it came,
Before the buffalo had time to eat,
Before the meat could be wrapped, it was crushed.
The water was not yet dry, and he was in a hurry to catch fish and crabs.
He's as greedy as a wolf who sees prey, as a hawk who sees his chicks.
A hungry stomach begs for wheat, a bland rice begs for salt,
A day or two as many as trees in the forest.
All the rice, all the salt, all the water,
Hungry child, mourning wife, blaming 
You see the hut, you go in, you see the village, you forbid it to go in.
The bat was held upside down.
Eat like a dog without shame, drink like a hungry pig waiting in a gutter without understanding,
His eyes can't see, his heart can't think, his ears,
Alcohol 01 ghè, chicken a con it must submit 
Bloodshed in the village,
They have strong legs, they have big hands.
They swing their arms and hit, they swing their legs and kick,
Beating the uninformed, slashing the uninformed,
There was blood all over his face, spilling onto the ground.
The village will suffer, the village will suffer,
The sunny season dries out the dead corn, the rainy season floods the village,
Planting withered beans, planting watermelon withered beans
What happened, what was done,
If the anger has subsided, the heat has subsided,
The wrong man, the guilty man must repent, the guilty man must confess,
The pigs must be gathered together, the wine must be opened, the sins must be paid,
White only has to hold it and tie it to the victim's hand.
May the wound heal quickly, let the blood quickly dry
Pray for good luck, dispel misfortune for the victims 
With a drinking stick in his hand and an apology in his mouth,
From now on, the bad things will pass, the good things will pass,
Nobody talks about the old stuff, about what they missed.
For beating a man for no reason,
The big and the small is unknown.
Whoever's wrong is right.
He who has not yet learned, he who has not yet known,
And he's hurriedly slashing people's mothers,
Aggressive as a wolf in the woods, fierce as a lobster in a cave,
Three came to stop him, and ten to stop him.
The one who says no, the one who says no.
He'll pay for it if he hurts.
Gently offer a cross of wine, offer a chicken,
If you hurt someone, you lie down. If you're paralyzed, you lie down.
Thirst does not drink itself, hungry rice does not eat itself 
His wealth must be replaced by yours,
He must take care of men until their skin heals, and their bones are strong, and his sins are healed.
If he beats a man to death, his crime is punishable,
(Beating and threatening the children of others) 
A son born of his mother, a daughter brought up by his father,
When the leg can walk, the hand can do,
Mother sweats, father boils tears 
Work day, sleep night, tired body, 
May the son grow like the bamboo at the head of the village,
May daughters grow like trees at the head of the stream,
Boys know how to weave, and girls know how to weave.
Knowing to receive beads, to send eyes, to make promises,
To be a wife, to be a husband,
He's an evil man like a tiger, he's an evil woman like a wolf, he slaps people who don't have mercy,
His foot on a wounded man's wife, his hand,
The body hurts, the soul is angry,
If your legs are broken, your arms are bent, your eyes are bruised, your head is swollen, your body aches, he makes offerings of buffalo and wine,
If his arms were swinging, his legs were kicking,
He baptized the children of his people with pigs,
His wife's piggy bank, he baptized her with pigs.
A pig he had to hand over to swear to the villagers.
The fight over jealousy,
Floating storms break branches, strong winds blow roofs,
The loud one, the talkative one,
Hands not holding, legs not resting 
Angry as a whirlwind,
The man who cursed his father, the man who scolded his mother,
Words and words never stop,
He struck the head of a perch, and he struck the head of a catfish.
Blood in the nose, blood in the ears...
The old man can't stop.
He said don't listen, she said don't quit.
Father stopped her, she cried without a thought,
They've broken their arms, they've stepped on their legs.
The villages above and below know,
Grandparents grieve, mother father shame 
Blunt blades are sharpened with rough stones,
Sharpening knife with colored stone (fine stone). 
Big things, small things. Let's get this straight.
Right and left are on trial.
About a fight involving minor injuries...
The heat has subsided, the anger has subsided,
What was right and what was wrong...
The wrongdoer took the blame.
Judge in front of the old man,
In front of the villagers to testify,
The guilty have to give thanks to the wounded,
With a chicken, with a drink,
Two people need to drink together
Apologies must be made, apologies must be made,
Don't be shy from now on, don't be jealous from now on.
The fight wound up just...
He's a hothead.
Like the dry summer grass,
A little fire burns, a little smoke sharpens.
He's a fierce, aggressive...
Like the beast in the woods, like the snake in the cave,
Before his head could think, his mind did not think.
He's been hitting people with his hands.
He's kicking people with his feet.
He has to apologize for the wounded.
With a pig, with a drink,
The crime was punished, the guilt was accepted.
The old story from now on,
The two sides will now live in harmony.
The fight was badly injured,
He's a fierce, aggressive...
Heat like the sun, burning like fire,
In the morning he makes excuses, in the evening he makes deeds,
Whether it's unknown, whether it's unknown, or whether he just struck someone with his fist...
He hits people he doesn't know enough about, he punches people he doesn't see.
Beat him until he bleeds, body crushed.
Beating people until their hands are no longer swinging, their feet are no longer walking,
Whoever says he can't finish, whoever stops him can't...
Blood on your hands, pus on your feet,
The wild grass on the field is not emitted 
No one chased the destructive ape.
His sins must be punished, his faults must be repaid.
He has to compensate people,
With one or two buffaloes,
When the buffaloes pay compensation, there must be pleading sputum.
He has to apologize to people,
With a pig, with a drink,
That's the guilt, that's the end of the guilt.
The crime of inadvertently causing death,
What he did unintentionally was lethal,
He makes the voices of men sad,
They don't bother to tread, they don't bother to prune,
There was a trial between people's houses and him,
We've got to figure out what's right and what's wrong.
If bad things are unpredictable,
If what you want to avoid is unavoidable,
Then the unintentional death penalty would be lighter.
If you walk without looking, or stand without looking,
What might have happened he didn't consider,
What can be avoided, he's not trying to avoid.
Then the crime of inadvertently causing death shall be severely punished,
No matter how severe the punishment...
The grave of the dead he must take care of, the apology of the house he must do. the deer of the tiger of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the deer, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer, the deer of the tiger, the deer of the tiger, the deer, the deer of the tiger, the deer, the deer of the tiger, the deer, the deer of the tiger, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer of the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer of the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer of the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer, the
The crime of neglecting to set traps and causing accidents to others,
The crossbow on his shoulder he hides at night, the arrow on his side he hides at day, the east he does not tell, the young man does not know, hangs the left root, plunges the melon root, he does not look, removes, rich he bears, his son bears,,
I don't know if it's due west.
Big animals trap old people, small animals trap,
On the long bow he hangs the right root, and on the short bow he hangs the cover,
His big nose is thick with rice roots, his little nose,
The squirrel hits the night he doesn't look, the rabbit hits the day,
A deer breaks his guts, a deer breaks his horns.
Fall trap also wear, hang trap also shelf, human leg clamp trap 
Stabbed the poor man's hand, punished him in the thigh,
His daughter's calf was crushed,
Victim's out of breath, he pays for his life, victim's out of heart, he pays for his life, he has to die.
A gong, a buffalo he must deliver, a pig,
The wine needs to go east.
The porch floor was too flat for him to touch.
His pledge to the gods he must promise,
The old man's pipe had to be touched and held.
Placing non-removable traps that cause accidents to others
The big trap in the east he won't take off, the small trap in the west he won't watch.
The big ones will not catch, and the little ones will not take.
A trap that will not be seen by day, and a trap that will not be seen by night,
The rich trample the blood that flows, and the poor swing the flesh that falls.
A boy walks across his thigh, and a girl walks along his calf.
The guilt he must bear, the guilt he must pay, 
His heart stopped, his breath went out, and his life was given to the villagers.
His life for the villagers of the west,
If your legs ache, your blood flows, the boar he must give in the morning, the female he must give in the afternoon,
The crime of setting traps without making signs (1) 
Place the bow in the bush 
Set a trap in the trees.
He's not old, sir.
Little kids he doesn't tell.
The bark of the tree he didn't peel for a mark 
His mouth didn't say a word, he said,
If someone has a broken leg, if someone has a broken arm,
The medicine he suffered...
The money he has to pay...
If someone dies,
His bones to worry about.
The dead man must pay.
I set a trap without making two marks,
Big bumblebees on cotton trees he didn't forbid fresh branches, little bumblebees on cotton branches he didn't forbid dry branches,
The bumblebee in the trunk was dry and he didn't peel it.
Big traps in the bushes he doesn't hide, big traps in the woods he doesn't believe in, or, children kicking, hands in the way, once,,
Old men in the east don't know, young men in the west don't,
His mouth didn't give the news, his teeth didn't show,
The man in the neighborhood below him didn't say,
One woman, three men don't text.
Tense bowstrings he needs to tell the old man, crossbowstrings he probably needs to tell the young man, sticking dry twigs, unrecognizable vertically,,
Thick burrs often attach fresh branches, sparse burrs often 
I can't see the green leaves, I can't see the dry branches,
Feet stabbed, hands entangled,.
Blood in the thigh through the biceps.
If his mouth stops moaning, his legs stop hurting, the pigs he has to peck to smear his hands, aim, stop his legs, let go of his hands, a loud shout he has to give, the black buffalo he has to load for his life.
The victim of the blanket can not cover, the blanket can not warm, the eyes 
His cattle must be killed to spread his legs, his gongs must be hung,
Evidence, material evidences 
Women must wear skirts, men must wear loincloths,
Knives must have handles, gauze must have blades 
Grass rakes must have teeth, towels must have edges 
Threes and fours have to be heard and known,
The buffalo must find a guide, the cattle must be slaughtered with a knife in hand,
Whoever holds the buffalo rope in his hand, whoever leads the buffalo's nose,
Right eye watching, right hand catching, mouth yelling 
We've got to get to his legs, we've got to see his face red, we've got to grab, we've got to smoke, we've got to stop, we've got to...
A woman's dress has to be taken, and a man's,
A woman must at least have a penis, a man must at least have a tube.
His arms need to be gripped, his legs need to be...
He needs to see, his eyes need to see.
Roosters need to recognize their legs, hens need to recognize their heads.
The legs are tied, the wings hanging, the words,
The witness, the messenger, drew a circle in the ground, and carved a mark on the tree,
A branch in the woods, a rock in the water.
You have to know, three people have to take,
Eyes see, ears hear, head understand.
The thing that was, the one that was received, as the gods saw it, 
Word one, man two and three he does not argue 
What's clear, what's known needs to be brought to trial.
The crime of refusing to repay debts,
In need of a loan, in need of a loan,,
Two years of borrowing have not yet been repaid, three years of borrowing have not yet been repaid, the paddy in the pot has dried up, the legs are new or old, it must be said by the village elders,
Promise to return the buffalo, but the buffalo is not in the cage, promise to return the grain,
Promises the corn, promises the eggplant, promises this time, this time.
Ask after him just to get tired, run after him just to get tired,
The debts owed to him must be questioned by the elders,

That's enough,
That's the end of the crime.
No one's talking about it anymore.
Compensation for buffaloes destroying other people's rice
They had early buffalo to herd, and dark oxen to lead.
He has buffalo, and is lazy to herd; he has cows, and is lazy to lead;

Our dogs bite people,
Raise a ferocious dog and not change it, raise a ferocious dog and not repel it.
Children come to play, old people come to visit, aggressive dogs chase, aggressive dogs,
You shall be punished, you shall be rewarded,
Give people dogs to do what they want to do.
To a man with a chicken, with a cross of wine,
White thread must be tied to the bitten person.
Let the wound heal quickly, let the bite quickly dry, aching hands look for medicine, painful legs look for teachers 
Let good things happen to them,
For the unlucky and the unfortunate go far, 
Then everything will be fine.
Nobody's talking about it anymore.
Killing other people's pets
It's a crime to kill someone's pet.
Got to pay for it with another one,
Be punished with another one,
It's his fault, it's his sin to pay,

What's done, what's punished...
No one brings it up, no one talks about it.

Reconciliation of conflicts
Become brothers in the same village, and eat with the same tray. Become a man in a neighbor's house under the village above.
The sick and the injured open the wine and call to me, and invite their relatives,
Big things, small things to take on together,
Float breaks branches, high wind blows the roof off,
He who speaks loudly, who talks loudly, who doesn't keep his feet still, whose heart is angry, stops resting the head of the catfish,
You curse your father, you scold your mother, word for word.
He beats like a perch, he beats like a bass,
Bloody nose, bleeding ears,
The old man could not stop, and he said not to listen, and she said not to rest.
Father stopped her, she cried without a thought,
No one is ashamed.
The body does not know how to hold, the eyes do not know how to look, the ears do not bother to understand the village on the lower neighbourhood, children stay away from colored stones (smooth stones).
They broke their arms, they stepped on their legs, they slaughtered each other.
The grieving grandparents, the embarrassed father's mother, the troubled old man, 
Dull blades are sharpened with rough stones, knife sharpened with follicles,
Big things, small things. Let's get this straight.
He who speaks before him who speaks after him,
The story is the same,
Right and left are on trial.
The crime of betraying his relatives and benefactors,
Before he was not full enough, before he was not warm enough, he saw pig dung, the caretaker, did not bake, the rice, the tears fell, there was a handkerchief,
The roof he looked up at, the floor he looked down at,
He's hungry for rice, he's thirsty for water, he's sick,
Pale as the grass without sunshine, thin as the string of squash,
Please be a man's servant to carry water, a woman's servant to cook.
The promise he made willingly,
He sees him as a son and a daughter,
He eats like an adult in a house, he smokes like a guest in Laos,,
New blankets he put on, new shirts he changed,
In the upper pot and in the lower pot he was eaten together,
Good wine he sips, good meat he tastes,
He became as brave as a mountain tiger,
To be as strong as a buffalo in the sunshine,
Big things he knows, little things he knows.
The day did not dwell until the afternoon, and the night did not dwell until the morning.
Working in front, hiding behind,,
As arbitrary as the boss decides, 
Treat yourselves like rotting grass in the rain,
Words are silent, voices are unheard,,
Pigs suck like villages abandoned by the plague, 
No one knows in the morning, no one knows in the evening.
Relatives are like garbage. Relatives are like rotting trees.
The landlord is like a cloud who doesn't bother to see, nor to hear,,
So he's a guilty man.
About pets falling into other people's traps,
The buffaloes in the lagoon were kept by their masters, and the bulls in the fields were kept by their keepers.
The rice on the threshings is pruned by the farmer,
There was an old man in the middle of the village.
Over here, the day he sleeps, the night he goes,
The buffalo with horns he doesn't watch, and the cow with horns he doesn't hold;
He's not a good shepherd, he's not a good caretaker.
They trampled the house of the buffalo, and the garden of the cow.
His leg's in the trap, his body's in the trap.
Their tongues break on their own, their blood flows on their own.
Big things don't pay as much as a buffalo, and small things don't pay as much as a cow, and you don't have to open the forbidden leaf.
Pigs don't have to be pecked, chickens don't have to be chopped, wine does.
This doesn't have to go to trial.
For the trees are tended by their masters, and the gardens by their keepers.
The bows of every hut are ready, and the heads of every hut are ready.
Dry marks laid, fresh branches laid,,
The men of the east are known, and the women of the west are forbidden.

The house was guarded by a servant,
Over here, the buffaloes of the forest are in the air.
The herd goes down without a sword,
Their three grains destroyed a field, and their three grains ate a field, and their three grains along trampled a hill.
The buffalo shall lead, and the ox shall pierce his nose, and the grain shall go to the temple,
Kehoo, the broken cane, the uprooted maize,
Eat less and pay less, eat more and pay more.
Broken leaves, gnawed leaves, lost souls, granaries made of chicken, hog kitchens made of pork, pơyan rơmo kư\ kă tơ\ mir găh kơ 'nâm.
The release of cattle before the harvest season
He who flocks the buffalo above, he who flocks the cattle below.
Legs on the east but head on the west, 
The wild buffalo are not pursued by anyone.
The fence on the field shall not make the buffalo, nor the stable on the field for the cows, a place, like a wild herd of beasts gathering seeds,,
No mornings, no afternoons, no cages, a buffalo shed,
He who has buffalo is lazy, and he who has oxen is bright.
No night in the day, no watch, let them wander 
The pumpkin rice season is blooming, the Cham pumpkin rice season,
Like three hril sucking on milk,
The grain of three along, uncut, like the grain of three o 'clock,
Before Ba greng Yuan could untie the rope, 
He was swinging his leaves.
Yang Ba in the field did not keep, yang Ba in the warehouse did not have time to report, yang ba in the east did not have time to invite, 
But the flour that came out of the grain was destroyed.
Ba Cham's seeds have been gnawed, Ba along his cotton buds have been trampled, Ba greng's lozenges have been crushed, the leaves of the east are of the west.
The buffalo can't keep, the cow can't shepherd.
Then we'll have to bring him to trial.

Rice flap is measured in width,
The master of the buffalo shall pay, and the master of the ox shall pay.

Cattle that injure or kill others,
There is a house, there is a kitchen, there is a field, there is a hut,
Sons carry water, daughters cook rice.
Guests to the wine must be watered,,
The sadness and the joy of the gongs reverberated.
Animals are in the woods, trees are in the mountains.
Water often floats in rivers, rocks often lie along streams,,
A buffalo must be kept, and a cow must be kept.
Cages on the fields shall not be built for cows, nor fences under the marshes for buffaloes.
No morning, no afternoon.
Cages one place cattle one place,
The man with the buffalo is lazy, the man with the ox is not bright, the wild beast does not care, the hungry in the woods, the poor woman of the west village, with a silver bracelet on her hand,
Night does not look day does not look, wandering like a flock 
The buffalo horns he doesn't know, the mad bull's eyes,
Running like a bull elephant, jumping like a tiger,
Human cataract, body contusion, broken arm, leg pain, blood...
He's an Eastern rich man, he's a...
Three-layer wrapping loincloth, colorful flower dress, gold chain collar,
Corn of extruded weevils was not enough,
The gong of the tribe was changed from the Lao, and the gong of the seven from the Kur, to whom his life was sacrificed,
The buffalo kills, he pays for his life, the bull kills,
The buffalo who kills sacrifices to the dead one day,
Cattle shelling kills in a day,
The temple is made of buffalo, which feeds the calves.
A gong as wide as the elbow, a mule as long as the elbow,
To the host with pigs and wine,
If the legs hurt, the hands are bruised, the eyes are swollen, the owner must pay compensation with pigs,,
It hurts for days to look, to look,
Alcohol must open the leaves, plug the needle, add water, 
What's wrong to take, what's good to keep.
About bulls chasing each other, getting hurt or dying,
The grain of ba greng was taken to the storehouse, and the grain of ba along to the village.
The hut is gone from the tribe of the ears,
The crows were straight as thin women,
The straw has dried up like a woman who has ceased to give birth, and has faded like a sesame tree which has ceased to give birth,
The dry season has come, and the sunny season has come,
The flocks were set aside in the hills, and the herds were set aside in the fields,
The grass of the east is the appetite of the buffalo, and the grass of the west is the appetite of the ox.
The buffalo plays with the buffalo that has the left horn, and the bull plays with the bull that has the right horn.
Their owners don't have to pay compensation.
If they die, stew the bones,
The buffalo are kept by everyone, and the oxen by everyone.
The summer mad buffalo with old horns, and the summer mad cattle with young horns, and the rattans, whose masters didn't keep them in cages on the fields,
The owner is not tied with rope, the owner is not tied with rope
Cattle escaped, bulls crossed the fence.
The old buffalo, the young bull,
If the buffalo lame the foot of the buffalo temple,
Cattle men with broken horns, blind oxen temples,
Ancient buffalo three cast iron temple by buffalo three cast iron,,
Two cast iron cows, three cast iron cows.
Your buffalo is your buffalo, your ox is your ox.
The temple buffaloes were brought back to eat meat,
The animal must be as good as the child.
No bargaining complaints, no bad luck discussions, sadness, to know.
What your grandparents taught you to remember, what your ancestors told you to...
Harboring stolen goods, stealing,
The tilebirds live in flocks on the canopy, and the robins fly in flocks when the sun is up.
Monkeys often gather together in packs.
The boys followed him to the fields, and the girls to the streams.
But he alone sleeps night and day,
Whispering about what no one knows, whispering about who no one knows, narrow shoulders, there, buffalo bones, thieves across the river, hiding bamboo dust, reverberating mules hiding huge roots Oh,,
The bad guys he conspires with, plotting with the long-legged,
Legs on the west, arms on the east, mouth on this side, eyes on the,
Like a male dog sitting on a cow's bone, a female dog sitting on,
Connect the bamboo stick for the ant colony to the kitchen, connect the trunk to,
The big ones he hides with the bushes, and the small ones,
The buffalo leads the nose, the cow leads the line, he conspires,
With a lid he opens and watches.
The seeds of green and red he chose together,
He joins hands with apes swinging trees, he raises ladders for monkeys breaking corn, he keeps,
The long loincloth of the Jrai he keeps, the Bahnar short shirt,
The blue one with the straps, and the white one with the baby,
Below the leaves of the trees drawn upside down, stored on the old shield, with the red-eyed women,
Night table with thick-faced men, day table
At dawn the distant echo, the rooster calls,
The wind blew black and white to ya ba's ears,
The storm came to Bok Kong's ears, and the old man's ears were black and white.
Yang good stay away, yang bad bu near him, 
Someone who knows, the whole village or, a day or two more,,
The young man asked, and the old man examined him.
Where is the gong of the gong of the gong of the shield?
Small things get small, big things get big.
It's got to be done right.
The house of the man who pays him, and the buffalo of the house of the man who comes to receive it, and the punishment of the buffalo and the gong,
Small sins are punished by pigs, big sins are punished by cows, bad things,
The concealment of slaves must be paid in slavery.
Killing livestock destroying crops without informing the owner 
The buffaloes in the lagoon had their masters, and the bulls in the fields had watchmen.
The rice that grows on the fields is planted and pruned,
The house in the middle of the village was kept by a watchman,
A boy who dares to be gallant,
The short stride required a day's crossing of the mountains,
Narrow arms that embrace the sky,
Blunt knife for cutting rhinoceros horns from his head,
No rope for breaking ivory in the mountains,
A woman who is as fierce as a wolf in the hills,
A child who is as hot as a flame,
The mouth has not spoken, but the hand has slashed, and the word has not spoken, but the sword has struck,
Long-horned bulls of one cast iron sleeve, big-necked females of three cast iron sleeves;
Cattle killed without rope.
Does anybody know who does or,
The story of the hundred years ago must be clear,
The unflavored rice is eaten by the buffalo, and the unripe sugarcane by the cow,
The landlord must inform the old village, the villagers or,
If he's busy in the east village, the west village,
A man sends his word, a woman his voice.
When a buffalo eats a lot, he says he eats a lot.
When a buffalo eats less, he talks less.
If the buffalo that eats rice on the fields doesn't bother,
If the ox gnaws at the sugarcane on the edge of the field and doesn't bother to report,
The buffalo died in the field he had to pay for,
Cattle died in the fields he suffered,
Yang to the east, he doesn't bother, sir. Yang to the east, he doesn't bother.
A hundred - year - old villager who doesn't care,
The owner of a buffalo or a cow doesn't care.
If the buffalo dies, he pays with the buffalo. If the ox dies, he pays with the ox.
His broken legs must be paid with pigs,
The buffalo leaves him, he washes him with chicken, the cow leaves him, he washes him with chicken,
The fall of the grain, the crushing of the sugarcane, have no cause to be judged.
The theft of other people's property,
Whoever sleeps night and day,
A craving for sour food like a woman with a womb, a craving for bitter water like a man with a disease, cotton, a man who has not yet made a nest,,
Sweet as a child on his mother's back, craving when the third rice is not yet,
Since the melons have not yet bloomed, and the aubergines have not yet buds,
From the daughter of a man whose ass has not yet hatched, whose breasts have not yet budged,
When Mom didn't want peppers, Dad didn't want tomatoes.
His arrows flared, his bows drawn,
His crossbow tied, his poison drenched,
His legs were on him, his hands were on him.
The stairs he's touched, the porch floor he's touched,
His gong was in his hand, his shout was touching,
Shoulders, arms, eyes chosen,
His buffaloes lead the nose, his cows lead the rope.
It's clear that one of them saw you.
The voice many have heard, 
The skirt of the woman who took it, the treasure of the man who took it,
His mouth couldn't speak, couldn't argue.
He's a guilty man, to be tried.
Theft of livestock and poultry for meat,
When you see a buffalo wandering, you must report it; when you see a stray ox, you must report it.
Believe in those whose wealth falls.
Over here he thinks the abyss is unknown.
He thought no one saw him at night.
A day of absence,,
His mouth ate the freshly picked sour fruit, the freshly roasted meat, the sweet drink of the kjar rope, and took it,
Seeing pigs lost in his hiding place, seeing cows forgetting his cage,
His head was covered with fresh twigs, his tail with dried twigs,
The day he sleeps, the night he leaves,
His hands were on the west, his feet were on the east.
His eyes on one side, his eyes on the other.
Like an owl looking for prey in the dark,
Alone as a wolf seeking prey,
Take from him who doesn't need to know men, take from him who doesn't need to know women, needy, young leaders,
His widow doesn't need to think, his orphan heart doesn't...
He killed the old shepherd's buffalo, he ate the cow,
Eating hastily the widow's pig,
On the neck of a buffalo he burns, and on the neck of a cow he throws his beak,
The gutters on the floor he buried,
He slaughtered buffalo in cages like animals in the woods.
Shoot the ox in his court like a deer at the edge of a field,
Slaughter a pig on the floor like a wolf's belly.
He had the audacity to rob the chief's wife.
The animal he robbed he paid with a precious drink,,
One of them had to be turned into four.
The offense of humiliating or insulting others in front of many people,
In front of so many people yelling at one another,
Speak softly in the fields and happily in the streams,
Sometimes people yell, sometimes people,
Everyone has heard, everyone has seen,
Makes people sad,
Makes people feel ashamed,
Makes people laugh, makes people despise,
Makes the heart more humiliating 
When walking why not ask, when going down the stream why not say, when being alone why not ask each other 
Why not ask gently 
If you have something to say, why don't you call?
Why don't you ask on the edge of the woods,
Improper work should remind, unfinished work should advise, unfinished work should instruct others 
Inflicting grief on others, causing shame on,
Ask the village elders to consider, reconcile and justify,
He needs to be put on trial.
Insulting others in front of many,
Knitting and being scolded for being lazy,
Weaving cloth again scolded as clumsy 
The buffalo is plowing to tell the buffalo to stop.
The buffalo is blamed, the man is infected,
Inflict grief on others, inflict shame on others. Gold is never clean.
The intestines are eating sorrel, the heart is burning like an ant,
Make a bad person make him wash, wash with water,
One for light, one for chicken, one for heavy, one for pig,
Less bad face, less troubled heart,
Ask the villagers to discuss, forgive,
Ask the village elders to consider, reconcile and justify,

The girl touched the dress, the boy touched the loincloth,
The sooner a girl finds out, the sooner a man finds out.
She didn't tell me, he didn't believe,
Any old man who knows anything or anything,,
Crossing the elderly like a deer through the village,
Wanting to outrun the young like a deer running through a stream,,
The footprints that remained on the bank, the mark of the curved part of the grass;
Daughter's back was bent, Daughter's breasts were bruised,
Day cravings sour berries on spicy, 
Night cravings soup water ash in the tube, 
Stealth makes the gods angry.
How can you hide, how can you hide,
Shallow water, dry plants, barren soil,
The rice does not flower, the gourd does not bud,
A pig, a chicken, a cross of wine on both sides shall be submitted, 
It's my fault you prayed, it's my fault you begged.
The stairs of the house must be touched, the pipes of the elders must be held.
Marriage offerings to become wives and husbands.
Boys and girls who are not married but have sex with each other,
Unmarried man, unmarried woman,
If you liked each other, if you wanted to be husband and wife,
Then the parents must, sir, the village elders must report,
By the way, what they haven't told us, what they haven't told anyone,
They've been sleeping together like husband and wife.
What they did was shame the villagers, anger the grandparents.
They have to apologize to the village together.
With a pig, with a drink to give thanksgiving,
If you like each other, you'll be married.
If you don't marry, the village doesn't force you.
Unmarried women who have children must make a sacrifice to the gods of water before they chop the grain,
In front promised, behind promised,,
Guys and girls come looking for each other.
Night comes by itself, day goes by itself,
Left foot walking by itself, right foot walking by itself.
The loincloth touched, the dress touched,
Round abdomen, dark breasts, buckled back,
Sons in the womb like pregnant buds have fathers,
Daughter in the womb like a pumpkin has a mother, 
Yang Sri (rice) they must offer with goats, 
Yang Dăk they have to offer with pigs, 
The foot of the stairs of the house must be smeared blood, 
Guys and girls have to open their mouths.
‘' Please don't remember, let go of the past'', 
The pigs are about to be offered, the chickens are about to be slaughtered.
We're just starting to talk.
From kissing 
The night he broke the soldiers off the floor,
The day he calls his deputy and asks,
He acts like a human being.
The day he passes, the night he passes like a man of the house,
People's daughters have been content with him,
Your daughter has spoken to your father, spoken to your mother,
The guy upstairs, the girl downstairs, they all heard the story.
What wife should have been, what husband should have been...
He denied it like he'd never done it before.
He denied it like he hadn't asked anyone before.
He denied it as if he had never set foot in the night,
People are not like wildflowers in the forest, they are not weeds in the field,
In the morning he breaks, in the afternoon he breaks,
He's a disgraceful girl, he's a disgrace to your family.
He shall pay for his sins with a cow, and with two bottles of wine, and with six brass cuffs.
Given the beads but from kissing 
Girls find themselves together,
Parents don't arrest, grandparents don't force,
As bees find themselves in honey, as butterflies find themselves in flowers,
Received bracelets, beaded chains worn
Like the handle on a hoe, like the hilt on a knife,
Waiting for the day we'll be home together,
And now he's changing his tune on his own,
He wants to turn his back on me.
He wants to take off the necklace he was wearing, the beads he gave,
Then he's a guilty man to be tried,
He shall give to the matchmaker a chicken, and he shall give back to the ring of iron, with a seven-iron copper pot.
He'll have to pay for it with a third pig,
The boy makes the girl pregnant but does not take 
Like bees to water, like hornets to flowers,
No one pushed him through, no one forced him back,
He said he was sorry to come, he said he was happy to come.
He stayed all day, didn't know it was afternoon,
He lay there all night wondering if there was light,
A man's back is bent, his breasts are bruised, and he weighs heavily.
The footsteps are hard, the water is hard,
Being married should have been...
The night is not over, the chickens have not yet crowed,
Turn your back on words, turn your back on things that are far away.
Now he argues east, denies west,
He wants to leave his people in a deep, shallow pit,
He wants to leave people in the jungle, poisoned water,
Crawling one he had to apologize to the girl,
He's got to open the girl's penance,
Two blankets he's got to keep the little ones warm.
The bracelet he must give, the fine he must pay,
If it's a girl, he'll have to look after her till she can hold a canvas.
If it's a boy, he'll have to raise him until he can shoot with a bow and arrow.
About being pregnant but not declaring the father of the baby,
My bad daughter said I didn't listen.
My bad daughter said no.
He steals at night, he sneaks in late at night.
Now his back's bent, his breasts are bruised,
My legs are kicking in my stomach.
Your hand in your belly knows how to swing.
The baby's father hasn't been seen.
The father of the child whose name no one knows,
She won't talk to me,
I asked him if he wouldn't,
She wants to give birth alone in the woods.
He wants to raise you alone.
He's a stubborn boy who refuses to obey,
He's a stubborn boy who refuses to obey orders.
The village took care of itself.
Wild virginity 
His father's advice to quit, his mother's advice to stop him,
You say you're finished, she says you're thirsty,
He's like a buffalo who won't rope,
Like a horse that doesn't have an erection,
Footsteps without seeing the mud 
Hands with no sharp thorns,
The bow's gone, the arrow's gone,
Now that it's happened, I regret it.
Now that my stomach is big and my back is twisted, I feel sad.
If lightning strikes, thunder strikes, death crawls on the field, death buffalo in the village,
The whole village is under his jurisdiction.
The village punishes him, the village punishes him.
His crime is one ox, ten cups of wine,
Cleaning the village, discharging bad luck for the village
So that the village does not suffer from heavy rain,
So that the village does not suffer from drought 
So that the evil gods, the bad gods do not come to harass the merchants,
If the fine is not delivered, and the temple is not delivered, then he shall be taken out of the village.
Who obstructs marriage,
The fire's coming and the water's coming,
Budding flowers that use their hands to break 
The water he stirred was cloudy.
The rice cooker was boiling and he put out the fire.
He's jealous of the birds in the sky, he's jealous of the fish in the river,
They wear beads he wants to stop, they give him bracelets he wants to stop.
Your wife is not a half-blood, and your husband is not a fraud,
He gets in the way, gets in the way.
If bad things happen, if bad things happen,
Husbands don't work, wives shouldn't...
Houses do not share walls, rice does not share pot
Well, there's a trial between people and him.
Theft of another's spouse
They asked in the morning, sir, at noon,
The bracelet was handed over, the beads were worn,
What should have been a wife, what should have been a husband...
The buffaloes have been slaughtered, the pigs have been pecked, the wine has been planted,
The upper village heard, the lower village knew, the fun was over.
The boy came to the door of the chamber, and the girl to the rice cooker,
The skirt on his wife's torso, the loincloth on his husband's torso, the melon in his sweet young hands,
He who robs his wife, as he who robs his young sugarcane, as he who robs his husband,
He makes people's kitchens not warm, their wine not...
He's the one who broke the whiskey, broke the gourd in the house.
He's a man who's done a lot of damage to people's homes.
He's a guilty man to be put on trial.
The crime of stealing the husband and sister in the house,
He's the sister of the same mother. He's the brother of the same father.
Like pumpkins in the same bunch, like gourds in the same litter,
And your husband, he's got it all right,
And my husband, he took it all away,
His sister's not dead, his brother's not dead.
You're not old enough to need a match.
I'm not well. I need a replacement.
He did what was right for the man above.
He's doing things that make people feel inferior,
He's the one who pulled the handle off the hoe, pulled the hilt off the knife,
He has to be put on trial.
Taking each other without reporting to the village elders,
Parents don't, sir. The village elders don't.
They eat together, they sleep together, they become husbands and wives.
They don't come to the newspaper,
The fig trees at the head of the stream, they do not come.
They despise old people,
They despise young people,
They drove each other home without a castrated pig,
They're going home empty-handed,
Village above inquiries, village below gossip 
A pig with two biceps would do.
A cross of whiskey in my thighs would do.
A sparrow's chicken is enough,
Let the boys downstairs know, the girls upstairs or,
Now that their sins are done, their sins must be confessed,
The village punishes them with pigs,
The village punished them with wine.
Husband and Wife
Husband and wife like mortar with baseball 
The cook's wife blows the rice, the husband plugs the wine,,
Husbands build cottages, wives mow the lawn, trim the corn.
Husbands hunting animals in the woods, wives knitting looms,
Husbands cut down trees and built houses, wives gathered wood and buried water.
Husband and wife must live in harmony
Rice is full of pot, corn is full of trusses 
Buffaloes in the yard, cows in the barn, pigs and chickens in the yard.
Corn trees above trees are good, rice trees above trees are green,
Right and wrong, end of day and end of night.
Husband and wife tell each other,
There's a big story with the old man, the villagers hear it together,
Don't leave each other like a rotting mortar,
Don't leave each other like a broken baseball,
Don't return a receipt.
Don't lose the one you've given.
We live together until we have a herd.
Live together until the eyes blur, teeth fall out. 
Husband and wife are at fault but have not apologized 
Men are to blame for their wives but not for the temple,
You don't share property with your wife to pay the fine.
Woman at fault with her husband but has not paid the fine 
You can't pay the fine to your husband.
Rice served water invited, words to hear 
Like a man and a woman without reproach,
When pigs are slaughtered, when chickens are pecked, when wine is offered,
Big errors are ignored, small errors are forgiven
Wife happily gathers firewood, bushes water 
Husbands happily set up hut,
About jealousy without evidence,
If the man is promiscuous,
If a woman has promiscuity,
You two hooked up in the deep woods and bushes,
Then he's got to get to the man's leg, get to the woman's hand,
Then he must have picked up the man who left him.
Then he must have picked up the skirt the woman left behind.
Three see, ten know.
Seeing it with your own eyes, catching it with your own hands, you're guilty.
He's only angry at the witch's mouth.
By the way, all he does is listen to his fortune teller and vent his heat.
He cursed fathers and mothers and children,
He's insulting, he's pointing at people,
He speaks poison, curses people in front of young and old people,
People have been humiliated in front of so many people,
He's been framed for wrongful death,
Then there's a trial between you and him.
Concealed abortion of husbands and families 
The girl in his belly didn't tell me,
The boy in his belly didn't tell me,
The girl in his belly, the boy in his heart, hiding from his husband,
He was sneaking sour berries out of the woods,
He tasted the bitter fruit in the valley.
He jumped from above.
From the bottom he climbed again.
He wants my hand in my stomach to stop swinging,
He wants my feet to stop kicking,
My son died before his feet hit the ground.
Daughter died before reaching the mist,
Mother's face unseen, father's hands untouched, brother and sister unknown,
But he did something cruel to the child,
He's guilty of me, he's guilty of the village,
His crime must be brought to trial.
When a woman has a miscarriage
Girls, boys are like seeds of rice,
Big daughter knows how to hold a loom
Big boys can shoot arrows with a bow,
Having a son is a blessing,
Having a daughter like the grace of the earth,
A girl in her womb must nurse, and a boy in her womb must keep,
The mother had a big belly and a crooked back.
Walk without looking, stand without looking 
Let a girl fall in her belly, let a boy die in her womb.
Mother guilty of her son, guilty of her daughter,
The unfortunate defilement in the village 
The unhealing makes mice harvest 
The sin of the mother shall be a temple, and the sacrifice of the mother shall be,
Let the stream flow in, let the corn plants up well 
Evil gods, evil gods don't hurt people.
Husbands don't take care of their wives and children.
In the rainy season, he doesn't go up and snip his corn.
He doesn't mow in the sunshine,
He's lazy at home, he's lazy at work,
All he cares about is that his mouth gets a big laugh,
He only sees his belly filled,
I want corn to wait for him to sprout,
I'm hungry to watch him mow the lawn,
He wandered through this house today,
I'm going back to the house tomorrow.
He let the walls fall, the columns rot,
He doesn't care about the land they fight over, the forests they take,
So he's a guilty man on trial.
A husband who leaves without taking care of his wife and children,
He leaves his lodgings, leaves his work,
He doesn't care about picking rice or trimming corn.
That's what he wears when he's planting sugarcane.
His wife hasn't looked at him in a while,
His son hasn't looked at it for a long time.
He's gone away without his wife, without his children.
The dead have wiring.
In place of the caretaker, the lodger,
By the way, he's as far gone as a dead man.
I'm home alone like a dead baby,
Wives at home are like dead men with no husbands to follow.
So he's the guilty one...
He must pay his wife with four buffaloes,
He must leave his wife with five poles of dirt,
Husband is irresponsible to his wife and children
In the rainy season, he doesn't go up and prune his corn and plant his melons,
He doesn't mow in the sunshine,
All he cares about is that his mouth gets a big laugh,
He only sees his belly filled,
I want corn to wait for him to sprout,
I'm hungry to watch him mow the lawn,
He wandered through this house today,
We'll skim the house again tomorrow.
Every house he drinks is a house he lies in.
He drinks in the neighborhood where he spends the night.
A hut without a visitor, a cattle without a guide.
Rice in the fields, corn in the fields for the monkeys.
With a wife he doesn't care about, a kid he doesn't raise,
He's a guilty man to be put on trial.
About the man who beats his wife or beats her to get hurt,
Big things he doesn't say,
He doesn't use reason as a child.
He's got big biceps, he's got big fists.
You fight with your wife, you fight with your wife,
Husbands have the strength to cut down trees and build houses.
Husbands have the strength to go to the forest to hunt,
Women as thin as grass, as soft as the buds of a young banana,
He did it like a lobster in the woods, an alligator in the river,
He can't hit enough, he can't punch enough.
Bruised face, back pain, tired body
So he's the guilty one.
He had to apologize to his wife with a pig,
The mistake he didn't make later,
I'm afraid he'll have to.
He must show his remorse, his forgiveness,
In the presence of the elderly, the villagers must watch,
The divorce,
My parents said I couldn't, the old man said I couldn't.
As a stream a stream demands to be split in two,
Like a bridge that needs to be cut in half,
Alcohol has not yet dried up, but has faded, and has not yet faded, but has broken.
The broken gourd is no longer healed.
The voice from the day before was no longer good, the laughter from yesterday was no longer funny,
They wanted to remove the beads, return the bracelets.
Decided not to go to the forest together, not to the fields together,
Things like that are done, things like that are done,
Parents don't force, grandparents don't force.
The old man and his wife must tell the story, and the villagers must hear it.
Taking a second wife
The pledge he made to the chief...
Round handed, beads worn 
The wine's on, the chicken's cold,
The village above the neighbourhood has heard the commitment of the couple 
And now he wishes to betray his oath,
Houses with roofs want to add roofs
Knife with a hilt wants another hilt
He's greedy, he can't eat enough, he can't drink enough.
His greed is as great as the waters of the river.
His greed is as thick as the leaves of a forest,
Not enough to raise a wife, not enough to take care of a child,
The rice in the pot was never full.
There's never enough grain in the barn.
The shirt was borrowed, the grain was borrowed.
He's talking about getting married twice,
To marry a second wife, the buffalo must be full of cages, the cows full of fields,
He who wants to take his father's wife, he hangs it from the house without a place to hang it.
There's no place in the house for a cup.
The old man's story to hear, the villager's story to discuss.
Married couples leave each other,
One was wearing beads, the other was handing out bracelets.
One side said yes and the other said no.
They became husband and wife,
The upper village knows, the lower village knows.
And now he speaks of east and of west,
Needle is plugged in and the hand wants to pull out.
The fire was strong and wanted to be put out.
The man who speaks east makes west,
Makes your heart merry, makes your face sad,
Making your father angry, your mother angry,
He is the man who has disgraced your name,
He's a guilty man to be tried,
The land he must give, the cattle he must give,
He's got to pay people for the boar.
Of the punishment he must pay, the execution he must bear.
Spouse marries someone else 
Father's words prevented them from...
Mother's words prevented them from...
They have deaf ears,
They do what the village above laughs, the village below laughs,
They do vile, humiliating things,
They do what is tiger to heaven, shame to earth,
Makes the river dry.
The mango trees are no longer flowering 
The grapefruit does not bear fruit 
The paddy in your bed was left by the rats,
The upper calf of the parakeet was dissected 
Their wine must be offered to cleanse the forest,
The cattle they must give to disinfect the earth.
Husband and wife leave each other when they have children
Husband and wife like mortar and pestle 
Have a baby, take care of the water, take care of the rice
I cry with my mother, I hurt with my father,
One place at a time,
The face is no longer in the same direction 
The house was no longer shared.
The mother takes care of it, the father takes care of it.
Leave your wife, leave your husband, but do not leave your children.
The land for you must be taken care of, and the food for you must be counted,
Don't let me squint in the bamboo,
Don't let me wander among thorns,
Like a chick loses her mother,
Quick as a monkey who lost his father,
You left me, you're guilty of a big crime,
You left me, you're guilty.
Adultery charges
The day was not yet over and he hastened to change his words,
On the eve of his death he changed his face,
Years have not passed, months have not ended 
He was in a hurry to find a stranger who gave him a beaded necklace.
He and his accomplices were severely punished,
A pig they have to apologize to,
They had to take pig's blood and mix it with rice and pour it on their heads.
They have to find a place to stand.
Let old people walk by, children walk by, see their faces,
They'll pour rice and blood on their heads and say forgiveness,
If they don't take the blame, the punishment they don't do...
Then they'll be driven out of the village.
Adultery with an unmarried person
Married women traveling with an unmarried man, 
She had to compensate her husband for five or six buffaloes.
The man had to compensate her husband for a boar.
A married man travels with an unmarried woman, 
He has to compensate his wife for five or six buffaloes.
The woman had to pơkra (apologize) to his wife a pig and a wine.
Husband cheating
Husband and wife like a knife with a tail 
Knife after knife.
I'll tell you what, behind my back.
He who takes care of his wife and his husband is not full, and he who takes care of his children is not able to sing,
He talks of taking second wives and taking third wives,
I'll have a good time with the east wind and a good time with the west wind,
Knife with a hilt wants another hilt
Alcohol has not yet faded and has quickly dropped its need.
The vows of the husband and wife have been heard by the elders, and by the gods,
Now he speaks of east but of west,
He brings bad luck to his wife.
He forced my misfortunes,
He's a guilty man to be punished.
His wife has to wash off the bad luck, get rid of the bad luck,
With a pig, with five jugs of brandy, with a towel, with a hoop of brass,
Wife cheating
The hand that held the wine, the mouth that gave the word,
Storms to the east, thunderstorms to the west
The husband and wife have one heart and one heart later,
Already taken need to drink until the wine has faded, the rush has faded 
When they have struck the gong, they shall struck it until they have kept their hands,
Necklace Bead Chain Broken, Bracelet Broken
A traitor has broken his oath,
He's guilty of his husband's crimes.
He's guilty of what he did to me.
He did something stealthy, unlucky to his husband,
He had to pay his husband for a pig to cleanse him,
He had to pay his husband five drinks for his sins.
A towel, a bronze necklace to compensate her husband,
The adulterous woman...
Bracelet worn, beaded chain received 
The cow has been killed, the wine has been planted,
The girl from the top knows, the girl from the bottom knows.
Husband and wife story
What was promised, what was sworn to us,
You heard, the old man said,
Downhill to the mountains,
The east wind shakes the promiser,
The west wind has overwhelmed the seducer,
Now that the sword has a hilt, he wants more,
Knife with back handle want to add another handle
If it's done, the wrong man takes it,
There must be a hog for the husband and for the village.
To repent, to ask for forgiveness,
If it's not enough to be wrong once,
If it's not done twice,
The grown-ups say no, the villagers say no,
The perpetrator is stubborn and refuses to confess,
The wrongdoer has a stiff neck that refuses to admit fault.
There must be a trial between husband and wife,
Someone who cooks early in the evening must find her husband,
The man who pours out the waters must promise to his husband.
adultery fornication 
The night he goes, the day he sleeps,
The door was closed. He opened it.
Absent house he sneaks out,
Like a dog that snaps its eggs,
Taking each other at night, taking each other at night 
They've got big liver, big bile.
I want to pluck rhino horns off my head.
Trying to break ivory in your mouth,
The money the man left behind, the dress the woman left behind,
Saw it with my own eyes, caught it with my own hands,
Five saw it, and ten knew it.
The evidence is clear, they do not deny the west, argue the east,
They have to compensate their wives and husbands with a buffalo.
They shall give thanks to their spouses with a hog, and with a husband's wine.
Of the fine they are not taken from the common property of the two wives 
Fornication in another person's home,
A man as bad as a pickaxe with a blunt tongue,
A woman as bad as a knife with a broken nose,
They do unclean things without knowing what's wrong with young people,
They do nasty things and they're not shy with old people,
Makes them unlucky,
The evil they do in people's homes,
The foul thing they trampled on his house,
Cause them a lot of trouble,
Their families will be sick, their children will be in pain,
The fault of an indisputable woman,
What a man can't deny,
To drink bad luck to people's houses,
Five pigs, five wine, ten rings of brass,
They had to tie white threads to every man in the house,
That's the end of the sin, that's the end of the sin.
Fornication between a married man and a married woman (no ).
Married man, married woman,
She had a son on her side,
A man with a daughter on his back,
It's like a beautiful loom cut in half.
It's like a gauze sling that's being tightened in half.
In my sleep, in my wife's absence,
What they do behind their backs,
The dark thing they do behind young people's eyes 
His wife now holds the woman's hand,
His husband caught the man's leg,
Wrong. They can't deny the east, argue the west.
Now they have to confess in front of a young man,
Now they're being framed in front of the elderly,
They have to compensate their wives, they have to compensate their husbands.
By a buffalo, by a pig, by a bottle of wine,
They had to offer the village a pig and a bottle of wine as part of their thanksgiving.
About married men and married women who have committed adultery, who have traveled together once, and who are not widowed,
He's a married woman.
He's a married man.
No one sends forth a cause,
And they're doing the wrong thing,
Taking each other in the dust, taking each other in the dark,
Their crimes, their wives caught, their husbands arrested...
If they have a desire for mercy,
You must compensate your spouse for a buffalo,
You have to apologize to your spouse,

He went looking for another man and left his husband,
His wife knew, his husband knew the evil they did,
His wife saw it with her own eyes, his husband took it by the hand,
The loincloth, the dress they left behind,

Together they had to apologize to the village for a pig, for a cup of wine.
About married men, adulterous women, illegitimate mothers,
The man was severely punished,
The woman was severely punished,
For they dragged each other into the dust, into the woods,
Doing something that shames you, makes the gods angry.
They have forsaken their wives, their husbands, their children, and have done unclean things,

Therefore they shall make restitution to their wives and husbands with five buffaloes and a cup of wine; and they shall do so,

Widows commit adultery,
The leaves have not yet withered, the branches have not yet dried,
The night has not yet ended, the day has not yet come 
The gong's sadness is not over, the wine is not gone,
Tears aren't dry, nose isn't clean 
The weeping, the sobbing,
The sad, unresolved,
Sharing blankets, sleeping mats
And the dead have no mercy,
And he didn't regret it,
His eyes darted sideways and upwards.
Three years he has not been abstinence, three years he has not been youth,
The year is not yet full, the month is not yet full, the ceremony of the exorcism is not yet done,
Dating boys in the east, meeting with boys in the west
He shared the same pasture with a stranger in the wilderness,
The tomb is broken with sorrow, and the tomb is tied with anger,
It offends the soul of the dead,
It hurts the soul of the living,
The big buffalo must give to the spirit of the dead less anger...
A man with a wife who has children with another man,
Knife with a hilt wants another hilt
The thigh with the straps wants to add straps 
Good girl, good boy. He's had enough.
Greed is greater than heaven, greater than the earth,
Seeing the flowers he wanted to smell,
Seeing good wine he wants to drink,
Doing things that don't concern the scorned, the laughing,
He smeared his wife's face, smeared black charcoal on my forehead.
The necklace he wanted to take off, the beads he gave him wanted to take,
Now the big buffalo has to pay for you.
The wine he must give to his wife,
His crime must be brought to trial.
Widows are not allowed to bring their children to live with their new wives.
A widower without heirs,
Taking a woman whose father was far from them, 
He could start a new one, build another one,,
You and your ex-wife came in the morning, and you took care of her in the afternoon.
Losing their mothers living with their grandparents,
Absent their father living with his aunt,
Don't bring them to live with your new wife.
Don't bring them to live with your ex-wife.
Stranger fish do not live, do not swim, 
A stranger whose soil does not grow, and whose trees do not grow;
widow remarried,
The gravestone is dry.
The graveyard grass was thick 
The weeping man whose tears are gone 
The grieving man is relieved,
Years are full, months are full 
The ceremony of desecration burned the pigs, opened the wine,
The dead have gone to hell,
A chicken, a pig, a drink breaks up with the dead,
Erase yourself, erase your children.
Dust in the house is no longer crown 
The roots of the gourds in the garden, the roots of the pumpkins on the trees are no longer stuck 
Wife divorce, new wife,
Someone's got to put it back together when it breaks.
Someone's got to assemble an ashtray.
The shadow is gone, the body is gone,
Heavy firewood that no one brings.
The water was full and no one helped.
If the year is full, the month is full 
Want to find knitters, weavers,
Want to find men to gather wood and water,
Five drinks to open drink farewell to the dead 
Chickens to be slaughtered, pigs to be carried away to the wilderness,
So that the legs are not entangled, the soil is not stuck 
Planting rice well, planting corn beautifully
To make a big field for the grain, and for the paddy, and for the pot;
Marriage, new husband,
The husband's gone to hell,
The hut on the threshold has no visitors 
Grass growing in the garden without a grower 
The water is broken because there is no one to connect the straps 
Weighing wood because no one can carry it
Grass tears hands, thorns pierce feet 
Because the path no one follows,
For there is no one to lead the way,
The tombstone column of the third rainy season has rotted 
The grass of the three sunny seasons has dried 
The grave-breaking ceremony opened the wine, the pigs,
Want someone to plant melons with you,
Want someone to go down the stream and catch fish,
Let the voices, the laughter no longer mourn,
Invite your relatives, invite your neighbors over, invite your neighbors to come,
Together a pig breaks up with the dead,
Let's open the wine, put the drink in, say goodbye to the person who's gone,
Let the dead live in a world of confusion married,
Spirits were no longer in the bushes, hanging in the corners of the kitchen.
Cultivation when husbands die
He is as rotten grass, as dried grain,
The walls are super, the kitchen is cracked 
Words and voices were sad.
If the roof is rotten, it must be replaced.
If the floor is broken, it must be replaced.
You lose me, I lose you.
For fear that the family will fall apart, the race will perish,
Tray abandoned Ape monkey will come to destroy 
The hut is empty. Strangers come to look.
The dead shall go to Mang Lung to marry,
The living need to find a male-to-female match.
Incest with close relatives 
They sleep together like half-brothers and half-mothers
What they do is cause the trees to wilt, the rivers to dry up.
Shame on the birds, shame on the beasts.
The angry earth gods must bear,
The river gods destroyed the village.
Their sins are greater than the earth, higher than the heavens,
They must be punished, they must be punished,
Three big buffaloes, three fat goats, three chickens, three big drinkers,
They must bring it to the gods of the kingdom,
They must bring the water gods to relieve the village.
The blood of the sacrificial animal mixed with the wine they had to sweep the foot of the stairs to banish evil spirits, to drive out evil spirits for all the houses.
Together in the same family,
They're you from the same womb.
They're the siblings of the same mother.
Father's words stopped her, Mother's words stopped her.
They have deaf ears, and blind eyes,
The village above laughs, the village below laughs, the evil that they have done.
They do what is tiger to heaven, shame to earth,
Makes the river dry.
The mango trees are no longer flowering 
The grapefruit does not bear fruit 
The paddy in the pot was spared by the rats 
The upper calf of the parakeet was dissected 
Their wine must be offered to cleanse the forest,
The cattle they must give to disinfect the earth.
Married brothers (incest) 
As bamboo of the same root, and dust of the same dust, 
Pigs and chickens in the same cage, like fish in the same stream,
Mango spoon with the same tree, squash with the same top 
Their bodies are covered with mud, and their bodies with earth,
The naughty boy who broke up with me, the impudent girl who had an affair with you, had to be ashamed of the bull in the yard.
To the tiger in the mountains, to the fish in the stream,
They're not as good as buffaloes in cages, they're not as good as...
The head no longer thinks, the mind no longer thinks.
What they did to the god of the earth, the god of the river,
A dry stream, a shallow river, a dead shrimp, a dead shrimp,
Mud, gravelized soil, dead peppers in the house, dried eggplants in the field 
Thunder explodes, lightning tightens, mountains break, rivers melt.
Village banyan tree uprooted, stream fig tree uprooted
Their sins, the five oxen, were not enough; their sins, the ten buffaloes, were not enough.
Naked body, hands on the ground, feet in the mud.
They must crawl like buffaloes, like pigs, they must eat rice in troughs, drink water in mud,
Must wash away all the filth they've made,
We must cleanse them of their shame.
Brotherhood Relations
When father's breathing is weak, when mother's eyes are dim, her pillows shake,
Sister for mother, brother for father,
Small things I must say, big things you must know.
The light work of the sister must be replaced by the mother, the heavy work of the brother must be replaced by the father, the father must be replaced,
If my sister is bad, my brother is stubborn, I have to teach my mother, you,
I'll teach you how to break rice, and you'll tell me how to hold a bow,
A gong of brass, a cross of silver. Let me keep it.
It's loud, it's loud let me put it away
Ask me on the way up to the game,
Ask me at the watering hole,
If you're a stranger to me, if I'm a stranger to you, they'll have to pay for this and that.
Day does not command, night does not admonish, so that 
They punish you, they punish you, you,
You're wrong by one, and I'm wrong by two.
Rules when I get married before you,
I saw the sun before you,
I saw the Moon before you,
I know how to break rice when you can't kick in your stomach
I followed my father into the woods when your legs were just beginning to walk,
The hard work I carried before you,
The weight I carry before you,
If I get married before you in the future,
If I marry before you in the future,
Then you'll have to ask for my permission with pig's wine.
Children's responsibility to grandparents, parents

Betrayal of relatives and benefactors 
He used to have not enough rice, not enough warm clothes,,
He's hungry for bread, he's thirsty for water, he's sick of caregivers, water,,
As pale as the grass without sunshine, as the strings of squash without,
Please be a man's servant to carry water, a woman's servant to cook,
Tears were shed by the handkerchief,
The promise he made willingly,
He sees him as a son and a daughter,
He eats and drinks like an adult.
He smokes like a guest in Laos.
New blankets he put on, new shirts he changed,
In the upper pot and in the lower pot he was eaten together,
Good wine he's been drinking.
He became as brave as a mountain tiger,
To be as strong as a buffalo in the sunshine,
Big things he knows, little things he knows.
The hour of day shall not dwell until evening, and the night shall not dwell until morning.
Working in front, hiding behind,,
As arbitrary as the boss decides, 
Treat yourselves like rotting grass in the rain,
Words are silent, voices are unheard,,
Pigs suck like villages abandoned because of the epidemic, 
No one knows in the morning, no one knows in the evening.
Relatives see as garbage grass, 
Relatives see as decaying trees, 
The landlord like a cloud does not care to see,
Good words don't bother to listen,
So he's a guilty man.
Crimes against parents or loved ones 
He's as sharp as a sword, son of the east village,
As sharp as a sickle the daughter of the west village,
As the newly created trap of the seasonal hunter, 
Like the new bow of the old man of the dry season,
A sudden burst of heat and his relentlessness,
An angry he slashed mercilessly,
Strong foot, he kicked me in the back,
The strong man, he punched his mother in the stomach,
The old body was shaking like a crushed banana,
Tears on her cheeks, a runny nose on her lips, 
He's as aggressive as a summer buffalo.
He's as fierce as a bull elephant.
His limbs were swinging like a madman.
Night knows no way, day knows no way,
The boar he had to whip for me in the morning,
The female has to peck her mother in the afternoon,
One drink or two, he'll have to open it.
The old pipe he touched.
Crime Against Parents 1
Thanks to the new water flowing, thanks to the soil new plants grow 
When I was a kid, my mom didn't eat rice, my dad didn't feed me fish.
How can one day know how to squeeze water and crush rice?
When I was a kid, if my mom didn't teach me, my dad didn't train me to run,
How will one day know how to shoot animals with a crossbow, how to fight gongs with a stick,
And what your father told you not to do, what your mother taught you not to do,
He beat up his father, slapped his mother.
You're bigger than an elephant, stronger than a tiger.
How does the river get past the source?
Fish do not live outside the stream
He's outspoken, he's done too much...
He's a guilty man to be tried.
Crime Against Parents 2
The asparagus grows because of a leaf.
The geckos run because of trees.
Green leaves are rooted,
The water flows because of a source.
The roof is tall because of the columns.
The broth is cooked by fire,
My feet are on your back,
Your head is wise because of my heart.
A fool must be taught,
The ears of the deaf shall be opened.
If you're lazy, I'd advise you,
Daughter who can't handle water, you have to teach her,
You said he didn't listen and he waved his hand.
I taught him not to listen, but to kick.
So he's a guilty man.
Children leave their parents in other villages,
His parents gave birth to him, his father was weak, he didn't care.
Thin mother he didn't care about,
For his sake, as the grain rots,
I'm as rotten as grass for him,
But now he is grown, and his head is wise,
He left his father, left his mother and went to another village.
His head has forgotten, his ears don't remember.
The foster father, from his youth,,
She has been nursing since she could not run.
He's the one with the big sins.
He's the one who's been carrying the brunt of my sins.
If his head won't listen,
If his ears don't understand the mistake he's made,
Wealth, property left behind by our parents,
Part of it he doesn't get, either.
He didn't get two either.
Parental abuse of children
If you hit me too hard, if I yelled at you too loud,
Early weeping, late moaning,
Tears running, runny nose 
Makes his whole body hurt, makes his whole body bruise,
It turns your face purple with fear, it wrestles with pain, it weeps,
One said no, three said no.
Their parents no longer have the right to raise them.
Vagrants and tramps,
He wandered like a summer buffalo, loose as a homeless man,,
Morning on the east, afternoon on the west, 
The day he sleeps like a pregnant woman, and the night he walks like an animal of prey,
I don't know, Dad doesn't know.
The rice he eats is white, the soup he chooses is good.
His father's fine meat baked, his uncle's fine wine he drank,
He is like a bow and arrow whose rope has been loosened, like a pick whose tongue has been blunt, like a sharp knife whose nose has been broken, whose mouth has been chewed,
Left foot didn't walk, right foot didn't run, hand didn't do it.
His eyes were not closed, but his head was asleep, and his ears were not covered, and he was deaf.
The kitchen's empty. He's not afraid.
He doesn't mind the thunder,
Men's swords he leaves in the middle of the village, garlands he throws in the woods, nights he can't stop.
Like a summer buffalo who can't get tired, like an owl who cries,
His mouth was as wide as a bow, and his belly as wide as a spade,
His hands are as long as a fortune-teller's staff, his heart is callous, his ears are deaf.
Dad said I wore it too, Mom taught me not to mind.
His servants shall come to him, and his elders shall hear him, and let him speak,
We've got to clear his ears, light his head.
Regulations on performing the wedding ceremony of single wives 
To marry a second wife, the husband must ask the first wife's permission and pay the first wife's allowance. The allowance must be delivered to the wife in front of the patriarch. The second wife's marriage is more convenient. When the ceremony of pơkong pan sik, pơkong pan por, the husband and the two wives are both present, but only the husband and the second wife exchange needles and meat for each other. When the ceremony of pơkong tep, three people lie down but do not change the blanket. The ceremony of shoveling does not do. From then on, the husband calls the first wife Akan (the original wife) and the second wife Akan goi (the top wife). At night, all three people sleep in the same room. How many jobs the first wife did, the younger wife must take all the stretchers. The first wife has received her husband's compensation, she must not be jealous anymore. If she stops, the husband sues and claims the money and still has the right to keep the younger wife.
CHAPTER 3: RELATIONSHIP IN PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS
The division of property and land in the village
The cow has herd, the buffalo has herd.
People live with fathers and mothers, brothers in the upper villages, brothers in the lower villages,
The right thing to do, the wrong thing to say.
Fish in the streams hunt together, animals in the forest hunt together, water in the source drinks together,
Above the sky, below the earth, below the river, above the mountain,
Want to build a house in the village, want to thrive in the forest,
The earth god must offer, the forest god must ask,
The villager must know,
The village patriarch divided the land to build houses, divided the land to plant rice.
To the satisfaction of the east, to the satisfaction of the west,
The land is divided, and the rivers divided, neither shall he contend, nor shall he take it.
The village's land ownership
The pickaxe, the sling, the bearer,
Small tree growers, big tree growers,
Weeds, cleared thorns,
Sweat on my back, tears on my chest,
The work of men, the labor of men,
Round wire wrapped tree stump 
Plants planted in the corner of the garden 
The land is now owned
The garden has been inhabited since then.
The land will be given to you if the master loses it.
If the owner misses, the land is for you.
The villagers above are not to be taken.
The villagers downstairs can't take it.
Family land manager's benefits
The land is like the back of our ancestors, the land is like the shoulders of our ancestors.
Once every three years he visited,
Visiting the banyan tree of the village, 
Fearing that the marked coniferous trees would be cut down, fearing that the daisy trees of the forest would be cut down, fearing that the fig trees of the headwaters would fall and block the road.
Afraid of the east, and of the west, and of the east.
The land is afraid of encroachment.
The land our grandparents used to give to our grandchildren, the land our parents used to give to our children.
Boys are divided, girls are divided.
The owner of the land shall watch over it, and the owner of the land shall watch over it; and the dead shall be kept by the children of the land.
Villagers must know, clans must know.
Every three years a gift of grain, every three years a gift of chicken wine, every three years a gift of health,
The feet of the master of the land are strong, and the hands of the master of the land are flexible.
Land boundaries that no one dared to divide, 
The daisy of the headwaters must not be destroyed, and the figs of the village must not be cut down.
Determining boundaries and trespassing
Tree marking corner garden 
Rows of stones stacked tightly on banks
Round wire wrapped around the base 
The tree has been stripped of its bark 
Gardens like that are already people 
Land like that is already mastered 
And yet, the shield he's wearing...
The rope around the base of the tree, he doesn't care.
Despite the effort you've put in, despite the sweat you've lost...
He's fierce as a hungry tiger, he's evil as an evil demon,
The land he took, the rivers he took,
He's a big man with balls,
Then there must be a trial between you and him.
Disputes over land
Whoever planted the corner of the garden
Coil Who Wraps Tree Stumps
The day is unknown, the night is unknown.
It's one for the other.
It's like a tangle,
The lower villages have to ask questions, the upper villages have to investigate,
Children have to know that old people have to be,
What must be done for the day, for the night,
The village elders must do what pleases the people above.
The village elders must be disposed of in order to win the favor of the people below,
What's right and what's wrong needs to be clear.
The crime of conquering land,
The land of the villages he came to occupy,
The forest of his gods he came to possess,
The river's water washed over him.
The stream is calling for him to stop.
The rich man's staircase he broke down.
The poor man's porch he stepped on.
The ivory on the elephant's mouth he robbed,
The horns of the rhinoceros he came to break,
On the back of the elephant he came to the bucket,
Trawling eastwards, he encroached.
Trawling west he came to invade,
He wants to try the rhinoceros in the valley.
Want to try the mountain leopard,
He's got the guts and the guts of an evil wolf.
Like mad dogs in the summer who don't know the way,
Like crazy summer buffalo who don't know the way,
So he's guilty of the village.
It's to the landlord's fault,
The crime of encroaching upon others,
The stump of the marker is still...
The stack of stones has not been shaken 
It's been a long time since we used poop as a marker,
The planting of trees as a boundary already exists 
And now he's playing with ambiguity in broad daylight,
Make a fool of yourself in the middle of the night 
The cover he wants to take,
The land he wants to encroach upon.
He's the one who's not standing right, who's not doing well.
He bullies the poor, insolent with the rich,
His crime must be brought to trial,
On trespassing on someone else's property,
Why should the land be encroached upon by men?
The land which was taken by men,
The river with the floating stars came to stop,
The woods are disturbed by the spirits,
Banana trees are blooming and chopping,
Why is the owner burning the house,
The gong that knocks stops his hands.
The drums were screaming, but the sound was muffled.
In front of the dissatisfied one, 
On the back of a man who refuses, 
The gods sulked, and they turned away.
He who possesses the earth, and the forest that destroys,
He poked through the heart of the earth.
Five buffaloes, three drinks he has to pay,.
Three - gang castrated pig he must have, 
The big ones, the small ones he's gotta admit to.
Burning and burning and burning people,
One block of houses, one bank,
The common waters, the houses on one roof, the way up, the fields of the same place, the same place.
The tall weeds weed together, the little owls weed together,
Yellow rice and cotton and pickles and bolts and wedges,
The hoes are full, the trees are dry,
Word back, bad, good is not reported 
The grass has not yet settled, the leaves have not yet dried, the fire has not yet been put out, and the spread has been blown away,
Small fires are fine, big fires, I should say, fires,
The wind came to the threshing floor of the house, and the rice burned, and the master did not know,
It is the fault of the one who burns the fire, and the fault of the one who burns it,
He who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet, he who burns at the soul of millet,
Burning people to clean up, burning people's huts,
You shall be punished with chickens, with pigs, with yang, and with crosses.
You don't ask for too much, you help each other.
It's normal when you're reconciled, eating chicken and pork and drinking wine together,
No hatred, no hatred,
Forcible expropriation of property from another person,
He didn't ask for it, he took it. He didn't ask for it, he took it.
He believes in strength, he believes in power.
He took the grain out of your pantry on his own initiative.
He led the buffaloes into your cage with his own hands.
The weak he beats, the little he curses,
He rapes the poor kids, he's insolent with the rich kids.
He's a cruel, greedy man.
His crime must be brought to trial.
Theft of cattle,
He's a man who sleeps at night.
He's a woman with eyes and hands.
Lazy as an old bitch,
Likes to eat of sour, likes to drink bitter water, 
Ham the wife of the rich in the second chamber, and his daughter in the third chamber, chief of the east,,
The occupier of the buffalo of the chief of the west, the robber of the cattle of the prison,
White-faced daytime robbery,
He's not afraid of Bok Kong getting angry.
Don't be afraid of the clouds of Yahweh,
The smooth-tailed buffalo the master has measured, the big-necked cattle the farmer has received, the cattle have known,
Wooden locusts hanging buffalo owners accustomed, mine root bamboo perennial owners 
The buffalo ropes are stained, the cow ropes are stained with manure.

Son as father's heart, daughter as mother's breath,
The caretaker of your land,
I used to follow you when I was growing up,
Older girls used to carry water with their mothers,
The ears must be clear, the eyes must be bright.
It's ancient history to remember.
Adoptional woman,
A woman is not allowed by God to have a daughter,
A woman is not allowed to have a son,
Your son, your sister's daughter is in foster care.
Raised him before he could walk,
Dampened it before it even started running.
He grew up healing when he was sick.
Growing up, he and his father started a hut,
When he grew up with his mother, he drank water and pounded rice,
He treated me like his own mother.
She saw you as her birth father.
The hard work he carried, the big work he carried,
Then when Dad died, Mom died,
The land he's entitled to look after,
The gong it is kept in the house 
The male buffalo and the female buffalo in his cage are herded.
Breaking people's kitchens 
There is a kitchen god in your house, and a rice god in your house,
Every year they slaughtered pigs for the Kitchen God,
Every year they open a wine offering to the God of grain,
I have filled the house with gongs, and with pigs and fowls, and with fields,
Raising cows quickly, raising buffaloes quickly.
He comes to life like a madman,,
He came looking for trouble like a drunk.
He threw out a fire on a man's kitchen.
He kicked your rice cooker with his foot,
The fire god will be angry and destroy,
The god of grain will sulk and leave,
Someone in the house is sick and in pain,
Something bad is happening in the house,
The fault is his, the crime is his.
So he's guilty and he needs to be tried.
Breaking our rice cooker,
The god of fire gives light, the god of warmth in the house,
He's a man of fiery temper.
Scolding you in the morning, scolding you in the afternoon.
The anger he doesn't hold, the heat he doesn't hold,,
His legs kicking, his arms swinging,,
The stove was burning in a scorched fire, the rice was scattered in the pot.
He won't let me, she won't.
The taboo he's inflicted,
The reaper will be angry, the fire god will blame,
When the heat has ceased, and the anger has ceased,
He had to give a pig to keep his family healthy.
Don't go hungry, cholera, freezing fever,,
You must offer a drink of thanksgiving.
To grow a lot of rice husks, 
Raising buffaloes to lay a lot, raising cows to lay a lot,,
Don't be hungry for debts.
He must show mercy, and forgive what he has done.
If guilt is not admitted, guilt is not punished,,
The kids in the house are sick because of him.
The old man in the house is in pain because of him.
I stepped on someone's dress,
The skirt he stepped on,
The man's shirt he stepped on.
It's like kicking yourself.
It's like stepping on a body.
People should be sick,,
Eating in blankets, drinking in blankets,
I can't stand. I can't walk.
The wine he must open, the chicken he must squeeze,
To offer apologies to people,
CHAPTER 4: THE LAW ON ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES PROTECTION
Customary Law on Land Management 
The land that my grandfather left me,
Soil for the production of rice seeds, soil for the production of beans,
The man who has the land shall tend it,
He who has the forest shall look after the forest.
The land and the forest are to blame.
Corn in the trough for parrots to peck, 
Melons in the fields, for the squirrels to spare, are reprehensible,
Land to be encroached upon by others,
A forest to be taken by someone who wants to take it.
Then he's a guilty man.
The village elder scolds him, and he takes it.
The villager collects the land, he has to bear it.
People with land resources 
The land is your crotch, your crotch, your back.
Forest land is not for sale
The land is not for sale.
Every man's land is his own.
Every man's land,
The land must be cared for, and the forest must be guarded.
Don't let people compete.
Corn plants up nice, rice plants up good 
Losing a father to a child, losing an uncle to a grandchild...
The lazy doer, the voracious drinker 
The land he sells, the forests he takes...
He made the god of the earth angry and left,
He made the water god run away.
His daughter will starve,
His son will come out poor,
He's a guilty man to be put on trial.
Ownership of village land
Land within the boundary of the village is the property under the common ownership of the village. Anyone who wants to cultivate and exploit it must get the permission of the villagers and the village elders. Private ownership will be recognized if the individual has put his or her effort and wealth to exploit. Boundaries of ownership are determined by the phenomenon of marking such as stripping a piece of bark at the base of the tree, tying a loop around the base, stacking stones around the land... Since such marking, the land has its owner and no one is allowed to infringe. If anyone infringes, lightly fined pigs and chickens at the request of the village elders or land owners. Severe, they must give Yang to the village for violating the village law and pay compensation and fines for buffaloes and cows to the village.
Ownership of family land, family lines
When owning the land of the family, the family line, the descendants are responsible for protecting, caring for young, preserving that property. If the descendants are not responsible for preserving the inherited land, they will be reprimanded by the villagers or may be recovered and returned to the village community. The inherited land, the descendants have the right to use but absolutely no right to trade, assign to others. Because that will make the gods angry, destructive not only for that person but also the whole village to bear. So whoever violates will have to pay compensation and fines for the entire village. 
For not taking care of your land,
The land is like a horse without a master.
The land is like a buffalo without a shepherd.
The hut must be kept, and the land must be visited.
Good soil makes trees green.
Banana trees and sugarcane trees grew abundantly,
So the water doesn't stop flowing, the fish don't stop swimming,
If someone treats the earth like a young bull in the woods,
If someone regards the earth as a child in the valley,
The land is not visited, the fields are not cleared, 
Monkeys, apes, wild beasts,,
He makes the gods angry, brings plagues and calamities to the villages,
Then the whole village will blame him, and the land taken by the village will be his own.
Incest pollutes the land, the rivers,
The land is like the back of an ancestor.
Rivers and streams are like your cupboards,
As the keeper of the first mouthpiece,
The ancient cook,,
Like water hyacinths, old forest fig trees,
If the son is not good, the mango tree will not grow leaves,
The spoon tree does not bloom when the daughter is broken.
Young people should ask old people,
The trees of the stream withered because the water was not clear,
Mon trees in the lagoon are not large because the waters have dried up.
The fern on the stunted hill because the soil is old,
Women don't get pregnant because they're sick.
Sons who have affairs often have sex with you.
My little girl used to hang out with me,
He who stops the waters of Krong Pa from flowing,
The girl who stopped Ayun's waters,
Make the trees not flower, not bear fruit,
Young people should ask small questions, old people should ask big questions.
Ask the water - head banyan tree, the fig tree at the head of the stream.
Ask the girls of the west village and the boys of the west village,
Incest prevents trees from producing leaves, prevents trees from producing tops.
You touched a chick, you pay a fine.
If you touch the foot of a pig, you'll be fined.
Dressed in loincloths punished a buffalo,
To the village buffalo, to the soil of the pigs,
Big and small wines for the forest, for the old forest.
In the woods and in the forests they lie down.
Big fields and small fields they spread.
The prostitute who owns a pig,,
The naughty man gave the village the boar,
The crime of burying the dead in the midst of others,
The bodies of the dead he buried,
Make the soil unclean, and the crops unpleasant,,
The rice doesn't produce cotton, the corn doesn't produce fruit,
Cane growers are not large, jackfruit growers do not produce fruit, 
The earth god was angry and left,
The god of grain was afraid to run away,
His descendants turned out to be poor, 
The bad luck was caused by him.
He must disinfect the earth with buffalo,,
He had to sacrifice his landlord with a pig.
For the return of the god of grain,
To make the earth gods less angry,
If the guilt he accepted, the guilt he paid,
Bad luck is washed away.
Then his sins are forgiven, his faults forgiven.

Boys do wrong, girls do wrong.

We share the same water source.
A stream drinking the same stream

River or stream water
We only use one side.
We're just taking a sideshower.
The other side is for grandparents.
The other side is for the dead.
Young children are not allowed to win 
Adults are not allowed to paint.
Whoever does this is guilty of you.
The sin of throwing dead things, birds' nests into the water,
The ghost shall be in the tomb, and the bird's nest in the trees,
It is a sin to throw the dead into the river,
It is sinful to cast a bird's nest in a stream.
The god of springs catches the sick, the god of rivers catches the dead,
The god of thunder strikes cattle, houses,,
I cause the wind to fall on the trees, and the rain to flood,
Don't do what's forbidden.
The old man and the old woman said, listen carefully to the right ear, and understand well the left ear.
Protection of watershed forests
He's a coward.
The young say no, the old say no.
The banyan tree at the head of the river he kept cutting,
The fig tree at the head of the stream he keeps cutting
Head did not think that hand did 
The mind does not think, but the footsteps,
Now the sick, the injured,
Cholera in every house, people dying everywhere,
The village is cursed because of him.
He must show his remorse, his forgiveness,
The wine cup he's carrying,

The trees know pain, the forest gods know mercy,
It's gotta be tight, it's gotta be rough.
The wrongdoer shall confess his fault, and the guilty shall repent.

For felling trees without permission,
The kids in his house don't come to the newspapers.
The old man in the kitchen didn't come,
Tiny plants the size of thighs want to cut must ask

Malay he suspects for women, 
Malay he suspects for men, 
His hands slashed, his legs kicked, 
Power terminal, power head body, 
The son of the upper neighbor saw, and the daughter of the lower neighbor looked,
The lives he kills pay for themselves.
If the dead man is found guilty, he rewards him with riches,
Big gongs he gives, small gongs he gives.
Pigs, slaughtered chickens, castor wine,,
Sins must be accepted, enemies must be erased.
To beat innocent men to death,
He's such a talkative woman,,
He's like a talkative woman.
The roof was empty, he climbed, he stepped, 
He climbed the roof of a rich house, he burned it.
The fire in his daughter's house, the one he broke,
The barn was not yet ready for him.
The words he curses in women's faces,
His spiteful scolding of men,
The son of the east village crying because he beat him,
Daughter of a village west of Coal because he punched,
They burned their huts because he burned them.
The rich man stepped on his right foot.
The poor man stepped on his left foot.

The boar's three - inch hands he's got to peck.
If people's eyes aren't closed, 
People's ears don't hear.
Hands aren't moving, feet aren't walking.
Breathing stops, the heart stops beating.
The covers of the fields were not given out, and the robins were not chased.
No one sets traps, no one removes traps.
Sick wives, hungry children, buffalo and cattle without a stable,
He's got to pay for it loudly, he's got to pay for it big.
The buffalo he gives the rope, the buffalo he sends the rope,
His wife divides the grain, his children the fire,

New graves he had to have people dig for the worms, 
His old grave had to be sculpted by a villager.

The big one must open the leaf, and the small one must put the needle.
Now that the good and the bad are clear,
Traces no one has the right to show,
No one has the right to remind you of the past.
The dust on the forest floor is now dry.
Drunk people kill people,
Forsaking, empty house,,
His wife doesn't care, his children don't care.
He drinks day and night unknown,
Spicy liquor makes him mad, he's a fool,,
You said he didn't listen.
Whoever stopped him didn't care.
The wrong thing he thought was right,.
Whatever it is that he thinks or,
Good words he drops, bad words he hears,,
The bucket of water he buckets, the rice cooker he kicks,
His buds tread, his young shoots bend,
The children he shouts, the old man he scolds,
His feet kicking, his mouth yelling,,
His hand won't fit, his foot won't kick enough.
You lost your father, you lost your grandchildren.
I cried, you moaned,
Villages above hate, villages below hate, 
What he said was clear, what he did was clear.
He's got to pay for it.
The dead shall take care of their graves, and of their temples;
His crime must be brought to trial.
About the manslaughter cases,
The little stick can't be threaded.
Broken hooks can't lure fish.
Excitement can't be productive.
The trees are standing and cutting with their own hands.
The tree fell and set it up with its own hands,
Speaking badly, and making a fool of yourself.
Clouds don't whip themselves.
The knife won't stab itself in the hand.
If it's not right, we'll have to deal with it.
We have to do this before the village is finished.
Right and wrong people need to know what to look up.
The sharp knife he tried on the body, 
The poison arrow he fired into his heart.
His body bleeds, his life is dead,
Head thrust into the bank, body shoved into the dust,
Mouth was dumb, tongue was hard, 
The killing he's been thinking about,
The beating he's about to get in his head,
The old man doesn't need to report.
His parents don't need to believe,
His brother needs no discussion.
He made up his mind like a wild boar with fangs.
He butchered himself like a summer buffalo.
The right thing he's thinking in his head,
Wrong thing he's got in his head.
Planning to kill himself with his hand outstretched,
He's guilty of this whole thing.
Intentionally lethal,
He's a man with cold hands,
He's the one with the evil eye.
Beats people he doesn't love.
Killing him without regret,
People's houses, fathers lose their children,
A man's wife loses her husband,
Now the iniquity of him is known to five men, and known to ten men,
Crimes are punishable by severe punishment.
He has to compensate the deceased's family,
With five, ten buffaloes, his grave to worry about,
The gravedigger he had to find...
Rice for the dead, wine for the dead.
Until he performs the ceremony of disembowelment.
If the temple doesn't have it, if the punishment doesn't work,
He had to sell himself and pay a fine.
He had to sell himself and pay for it.
He shall be a servant to the rich, and he shall pay the temple, and he shall pay the fine.
About a fight where both sides died,
If two parties fight and both die, the whole village shall be re-examined. Whoever is at fault, his parents or relatives shall have to pay the compensation. If both parties are at fault, they shall be punished.
They're grabbing each other like two hungry tigers.
One strikes, the other cuts, the right unknown, the wrong unknown,,
Five stopped me, ten said I couldn't do it.
They beat until they bleed, their bodies crushed,,
Legs motionless, hands not swinging, breathing stopped, eyes closed,,
Young children have to look up, old people have to ask,
What's right and wrong between you two,
If an innocent man were to die,
It is the deceased's family's fault for the damages.
If the guilty and the guilty alike,
There's no need for a trial between the two.
Every man's grave is his own; every man's grave is his own stone.
There's no more punishment, no more compensation.
No one will blame the incident, blame the incident.
Assault on another person,
The big and the small is unknown.
Whoever is wrong is right.
He who has not yet known, or who has not yet known,,
And he's hurriedly slashing people's mothers,
Aggressive as a wolf in the woods,

Ten men came to stop him.
He who says he can't, he who says he can't.
He'll pay for what he's done.

Old saddles, gongs you must wash,
He waves his gardens, and hopes for the round rice,
Burying the dead, not crossing rivers, crossing streams, crossing villages,
You can't bury a dead man in the river.
To bury the dead is not to cross the stream,,
The River God will be angry,
The Fountain is unclean. The Fountain God will resent,
Burying the dead doesn't come through the house.
Burying a dead man doesn't cross villages.
The village will be unclean, the village will be sick,,
The village will be destroyed, the village will be destroyed.
Hungry children, sick old people,,
Raising cattle without laying, planting rice, corn without raising,
Don't do what's forbidden.
He who brings evil, and brings burdens to the village,
The old man and the old woman said,
Adults must listen, children must remember.
It is forbidden to scavenge where the dead are buried,
Someone's been killed in that forest.
People have died on that land.
The grave has not been cultivated 
The column has not been erected.
Wine rice was not offered,
The tree is still standing.
It's got a low trunk.
The body lies in the dry dust,
The stream here is no longer in...
The land is no longer healed.
Traipsing with acquaintances is not a good idea.
A stranger should not set up a guardhouse,
Reconciliator
The dock is owned by a man,
The empty house is headed by a man,
There's a grandfather at home, there's a fire, there's a grandmother.
The village was headed by an elderly man,
The villagers sent the village elders to reconcile.
The children are wrong, the elders are wrong.
Newly hatched chicks are sheltered by their mothers,
There's thunder on one side, there's wind on the other.
On one side of the hurricane is flying,
On the sunny side,,
On one side it was raining like a diaper.
There's gotta be somebody in the middle.
The little matter they had to settle,,
Big cases have to be punished.
Which side is right, which is wrong,,
The mediator adjudicates the case,
Depending on the circumstances, a cross or a gong,,
Depending on the circumstances, chicken or pig temple,,
Depending on the circumstances, buffalo temple or cow temple,
They demanded that my gongs be brought down with crosses.
They asked me to put them down with pigs,
When the sun is strong,
We should just spread out, 
When the sun was strong,
We shouldn't be picking at rice.
For the sun will not rise on the rice,
When it rains, clean up the drying rice immediately,
When it rains to spread the grain evenly among you,
The rice is not dry because it rains,
The rice sprouts because of the waters,
The flesh must be even as the elders divide it, 
Let it be evenly distributed,
You have to be clever when it comes to handling things.
Be considerate as a mother comforts her children.
Must be gentle as lull you to sleep,
It's nice to see you guys back.
Pay the mediator 
The mouth, the mouth that can't hold,
Saying things that upset each other,
Open mouth, open mouth can't talk,.
Saying mean things to each other,
But on either side of the rock there is catfish in the middle,
Between the chicks there is always a mother who protects,
You say one word, I argue two words,
Both sides are divided,,
Your side did the wrong thing, your side did the wrong thing.
The mediator must act as an arbiter.
The old men will reconcile them,
Old people will help unite,
If the error is small we must try to ignore, 
If I'm wrong, I'll make it right.
If you don't like it, the pigs die.
Yang will punish you if you don't agree.
When women say one way,
When men say one thing,
No one yields to anyone,
Solved all night long,.
It keeps people from sleeping.
Someone has to mediate.
Getting things done,,
The man who spends the night without sleep,
You have to use pigs, you have to use chicken.
We have to use gongs, crosses,
You have to use a cross to wash it.
The conciliator is like the water - head banyan tree,
Like a fig tree at the head of a stream.
Thank you, my heart says,
Rewarding someone for saving someone else's property.
Wealth is exchanged for hundreds of sunny seasons,
Wealth is exchanged for thousands of rainy seasons,
Boats are made of tree trunks thrown on mountains,
Boats carved out of trees on hills,
A pig made a sacrifice, a buffalo ate,
Rain a week Krong Dak Bla rises 
One month's rain Krong Dak Bla drifting water, 
Water-boat, wind-blown, rope-tied.
The headwaters of his master's river didn't find it.
At the end of the river his master asked not to see,
Sand cover, drifting water, shrubs covering forest trees
Men found calling for help, 
The woman who saw her cried out to the bearer,
The east landlord has reached the rope, the west landlord has reached the rope,
Big boats win big prizes, small boats win small prizes.
Broilers, slaughter pigs, thanksgiving wine,
Chain beads handover, bowl bowl flowers are donated 
Hands over boats, hearts open 
The root of the banyan tree shall go back to the root of the banyan tree, and the trunk shall go back to the tossed tree.
To thank the man who saved my life,
I was close to death,
Like a fish on land,
Like a buffalo on a fire,
Like a bird in deep water,
People have come to help not afraid of high mountains, deep water 
Help until hands swing, feet move 
Help until eyes open, lips smile 
The labor of the laborer is not yet sufficient, and the payment of the laborer is not yet made in dollars.
To be grateful to those who save lives, help,
A chicken with two biceps is fine.
A pig with a calf is a pig with a calf.
One drink must be opened for help,
That's a good thing.
Recall the trial,
The fire had gone out late at night, and the cigarette in his hand had died.
The gongs have sounded, the drums have sounded,
The breathless man is buried, the hundred years are gone,
The buds have grown, the grain has sprouted,
The winds and rains, the strife has been erased,,
The dark evil is over,
The tossed tree, which had been poisoned and suffered,
The languid tree suffered because it was uprooted,
It was wrong to open the wine,
Now my ears are ringing again, my mouth is ringing again, my hands are shaking again.
Once upon a time he stirred things up again.
Insolence to the east, trenches to the west.
Challenging the mountains of Yang as high as,
More ferocious than a mountain tiger,
What's done, what's shown him to dig,
termite mounds have grown into mountains every year,
The trail has faded, the rope has rotted,
Now the rotting grass wants to be a bunch of paintings,
The tree was ready, and he asked for leaves.
The arrow that sent him back,,
The sleeping tiger woke him up.
The bear was eating him, teasing him.
His wicked words reminded him to turn again.
The trial has gone through many seasons,
The bracelet he was wearing demanded to be removed.
The string of beads he's been asking to let go,
So he's a guilty man,,
We need to put him on trial between us.
On the charge of reopening the trial,
Rice in a boiling pot, soup in a sieve,
The waters of the gourd were gone, and the weight of the thighs on their shoulders was heavy.
The fire had gone out late at night, and the cigarette in his hand had died.
The waters of the pool are empty, the fish in their hands have been caught,
The gongs have sounded, the drums have sounded,
The breathless man is buried, the hundred years are gone,
The buds have grown, the grain has sprouted,
The winds and rains, the strife has been erased,,
The dark evil is over.
The east house was glad, the west house was walking, 
The tossed tree, which had been poisoned and suffered,
The bamboo stood up and suffered,
It was wrong to open the wine, 
The buffalo ceases to live, the cow ceases to walk, and must be seen off.
Wrong ear has cleared, head has understood, of has submitted, 
Now my ears remember, my words remind, my hands shake,
He is like a broken gong, a fallen gong,
Squirming like a fox caught in a trap,
Once upon a time he stirred things up again.
He messed with the poor.
He's after the rich.
Insolence to the east, trenches to the west.
Challenging the mountains of Yang as high as,
More ferocious than a mountain tiger,
Higher than the gods of the sky,
It's done, it's shown he dug again,,
termite mounds have grown into mountains every year,
The old village grew into a forest every year,
There's no one left to remember the big things and the little things.
The tree of blood dried up, the wine of necessity dried up.
The gongs were hanging, the drums were ringing,
The trail has faded, the rope has rotted,
Now the rotting grass wants to be a bunch of paintings,
The tree was ready, and he asked for leaves.
He's got his arm stretched, he's got to pull back.
The arrow that sent him back,,
The liquor has faded and demands a new one.
The sleeping tiger woke him up.
The bear was eating him, teasing him.
His wicked words reminded him to turn again.
The trial has gone through many seasons,
The rice he chewed was puree (tongue) he asked to chew again,
The bracelet he was wearing demanded to be removed.
The chain of beads that gave him demanded to let go, to him,
So he's guilty, we need to put him on trial among people,
The crime of not announcing when it is found,
Wealth gathered up on the way to the fields,
The riches gathered on the way down the stream,
Animals were seen on the buffalo ranch.
Poultry saw it on the way home,
In the village or in the bushes,
From the rich or from the poor,
From a stranger or acquaintance,
Of distant brothers or of near families,
A mouthful of news to be heard.
Handing over wealth for everyone to see,
Spreads out like a stream of water.
Though the fat buffalo strayed for three days,
Though the thin cow strayed for five nights,
And though the gong was three long cast iron hands,
Despite the brocade baby towel, 
Three-striped blanket for the elderly, 
Women's Necklace Chain, Bracelets For Men,
The dragon-headed pipe of the rich and luxurious,
Must announce to find the owner who dropped, who lost,,
Don't cover it with banana leaves.
Don't cover the dong with leaves.
The storehouse is not hidden, the house is not hidden,
The buffalo must be given to the owner with the beak,
The cow must find the owner of the nose.
The gong whose owner bought it from Laos,
Whose mule is the owner changed from Kur water, 
Animals are ensnared who are set in the night,
Find their owners all over the village.
Looking all night day tirelessly, 
Ask the old man, ask the children who owns them,
If it comes to day-to-night,
As for when the moon falls and the sun shines,
The owner doesn't come out, the buyer doesn't see.
He who picks up the buffalo raises the buffalo,
He who leads the cow raises the cow.
The trapped animal was dried on the stove.
Necklace beads, bracelets of silver in a flower pot,
He who sees buffaloes gets buffaloes, he who sees cattle gets cattle,
After three seasons of labor, if the master knows, the livestock is returned to the master,,
The buffalo farmer is rewarded with buffaloes.
The cowboy is rewarded with a cow,
Alcohol leaf-opening, forbidden needles, pigs, pecking chickens,,
Brotherhood is intertwined.
Trapped accident shows signs of...
Large hives have forbidden fresh twigs, 
Small hives have also banned dry twigs, 
Even the stalks of the cottonwood trees were marked,
Anyone who saw it knew it and avoided it.
He hunted the branches of the trees that had marked the forbidden,
You hunt the marked trees,,
It is known to all who stand and lie,
The man who hurried down to the fishing stream did not bother to ask,
He who hurries up to the forest to gather up the shoots does not look,
He can see his ears, but his mouth doesn't speak.
He's like a 17 - year - old, like a 15 - year - old.
The buffalo ran through the forest tirelessly,
The summer stallion goes in search of the tireless one,
Like a forest elephant without a rope,
Village hunters on dried meat not yet on the stage, 
Village hunters under the dried fish not yet in the bucket, 
The mink flesh has not yet caught on the skewer, 
The venison had not yet caught the scent of the red charcoal.
Lay down on his left foot and pedaled,
Seven horizontal to his right hand,
He's got to take it on his own.
Scratched calf he had to wear himself.
Bleeding, skin abrasions, shaking knees, he's healing himself, he's healing himself.
Regulations on low-cow farming
Take the buffalo from the farmer,,
Take your cattle, and lead them,
Three - year adoption paid, 
Three years of leadership are divided, 
Raising buffaloes that grew quickly and were given meat,
Raise a cow quickly, and divide her offspring,
If I'm lazy to lead and I'm lazy to seek,
To stray a cow, to lose a buffalo,
It destroys people's wealth.
The watchman is to be paid,
The caretaker is punished,
They'll make a fine, they'll make a complaint.
If the pet unfortunately dies, 
Well, there's nothing to punish a foster parent for.
The dead animals were divided equally between the two sides.
Caught buffaloes ploughing,
The cattle were sacrificed to the gods.
The buffalo is a god to man who eats meat.
Cattle are not allowed to plow.
What the gods forbid, what the village appointed,
And he had the guts to mess it up.
And he had the guts to do it.
He makes the buffalo plow the ground,,
He forced the cows to bear heavy burdens on their backs,
The grown-ups stopped him, the villagers stopped him.
He made the god of heaven angry, the god of earth angry.
He will not bear it, and he will not bear it.
He must make a vow of thanksgiving to the gods, be punished by the village.
About pets falling into other people's traps,
The male buffalo in the lagoon has a watchman.
The bulls on the fields are usually kept by men.
The rice on the threshings is pruned by the farmer,
There were old men in the middle of the village.
Over here, the day he sleeps, the night he goes,
The buffalo with the horns he didn't even look at.
Cow's horn he won't hold,
He's not a good shepherd, he's not a good caretaker.
To trample the house of the boar,
The cow man's garden came in.
His leg's in the trap, his body's in the trap.
Their tongues break on their own, their blood flows on their own.
It's a big deal. The owners don't pay with buffaloes.
It's a pity the farmer doesn't pay with cattle.
Pigs don't have to peck, chickens don't sweat.
Alcohol need not open leaves plug need, 
This doesn't have to go to trial.
For the trees are tended by their masters, and the gardens by their keepers.
Every bow has its own bow.
There's no such thing as a crowning tree.
Dry marks laid, fresh branches laid,,
The men's trap in the east is known.
It's nice to have women in the west, too.
If a buffalo dies, and a cow dies on its back, the owner of the farm shall bear it.
About cattle destroying people's crops,
The male buffalo in the lagoon shall have watchmen,
The female buffalo on the field must be kept by a guard,
The house was guarded by a servant,
Over here, the buffaloes of the forest are in the air.
The herd goes down without a sword,
They broke down a whole field of rice,
Three milliliters of rice they ate in a field,
Three grains along they trampled a hill, 
The buffalo shall lead, and the ox shall pierce his nose, and the grain shall go to the temple,
Kehoo, the broken cane, the uprooted maize,
Eat less and pay less, eat more and pay more.
Broken leaves, gnawed flesh, lost spirits,,
The granaries of chickens,
The hog kitchen.
About killing someone else's cattle in his field,
Male buffalo under the lagoon often have owners, 
The bulls in the field are usually watched.
The rice that grows on the fields is planted and pruned,
The house in the middle of the village was kept by a watchman,
A boy who dares to be gallant,
A woman who is as fierce as a wolf in the hills,
Mouth has not spoken, but his hand has slashed,
I didn't tell you, but the sword was swinging.
Long-horned buffalo with cast-iron hands,
Big-necked buffalo three cast iron hands, 
Cattle killed without rope.
Does anybody know who does or,
An unflowered paddy is eaten by a buffalo,
An unripe cane is chewed by a cow,
The landlord must inform the old village, the villagers or,
If he's busy in the east village, the west village,
A man sends his word, a woman his voice.
When a buffalo eats a lot, he says he eats a lot.
When a buffalo eats less, he talks less.
If the buffalo that eats rice on the fields doesn't bother,
If the ox gnaws at the sugarcane on the edge of the field and doesn't bother to report,
The buffalo died in the field he had to pay for,
Cattle died in the fields he suffered,
His broken legs must be paid with pigs,
The buffalo leaves. He washes it with chicken.
The cow's spurs he washes with chicken,
The fall of the grain, the crushing of the sugarcane, have no cause to be judged.
Customs of health offerings for children when the soul is lost
Father in his arms, mother in her lap still crying,
Grandmother, he coaxed not to hold 
Two years of not growing up
Three years of unhealthy care
The lost soul child,
Someone dreamed that the baby cried, did not stop, did not calm,
Parents must pray for the health of the baby 
To the house of the dreamer of the child,
Bring a chicken, bring a drink,
The dreamer tied white thread for the baby 
From now on he will not be disturbed, he will eat quickly, and he will sleep well.

Two hands splashing water in the lagoon

Men stop the flow, slap the water 
Women scoop shrimp,
The old men on the banks gathered wood, lit a fire,
Every man, every job,
There's fish for fish, there's shrimp for shrimp
Every man is divided equally, evenly divided, evenly divided.

Deer horn for powder mixed with chicken blood and alcohol
